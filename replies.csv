"1","Kelli Poole","Hey Alexander,
As many others have mentioned, 100% affordable housing units aren't really a thing.  There has to be some way to make income and most affordable housing developers do this by co-locating some market rate units and/or retail space within affordable housing developments.  So Measure S would impact our ability to move forward with building much needed affordable housing developments."
"1","Jay Herman","As I see it, uber the law of supply and demand, which cannot be over turned, any impediment to building more decent rental units in Los Angeles, will increase the price of existing units.

This Measure will stop all building construction for two years and then permanently forbid those zoning changes that are needed to align a parcel into a correct zone for replacing a simple parking lot.

It is bad for everybody except for Michael Weinstein, AIDS Health Care Foundation President, that doesn't want the Palladium Project built because it might interfere with HIS view from the high rise next door.

AIDS HealthCare, the major sponsor of the bill should be spending OUR donations and their pharmacy earnings on something more important... AIDS Health Care, not a politically motivated for his own benefit.   

Just say NO."

"3","Brian A.","Truly appreciated. Based on the calendar, since my ""regular day is Monday, I am assuming the changes to Tuesday will be from Labor Day and Christmas Day. The question remains, why is this not readily accessible from the first page of the Bureau of Sanitations's website? It would reach a larger portion of our populace than a post on Nextdoor. Just as a useless added comment/question, maybe subject to labor negotiations, the 2018 schedule could be available on that first page  and on Nextdoor by October 2017?"

I called the Dept. of Sanitation's Customer Service on Wednesday (our regular collection day) to tell them the truck was currently collecting on the regular street day instead of the published delay which should have been Thursday. The Customer Service guy was mystified as to why this happened, so beware: the published holiday collection times may not be as advertised. I guess it depends on how much the driver wants to get through his weekly schedule..."

Call first Michelle is always working in her home office.
I went to Hawaii twice and went to Kaanapali Beach in Hawaii.
It was my first trip and I loved the detail Michelle put into my travel plans and having a bad back she had a wheelchair waiting for me at both airports upon my arrival. Michelle ensured my visit was perfect and I wanted a condo and I ordered through her so it was there upon arrival and the condo on the beach was awesome and everything was there in walking distance. Shopping, eating food courts, restaurants, she called to make sure we had everything and more.
It was my dream vacation so car rental, plane reservations and condo all in a great package with coupons and we went in June so weather was perfect and everything so close we did not leave. Michelle has many years of knowledge and voted Number 1 Travel Agent
in Valley.  It was so great we went again the following year with same experience Awesome!  You do not pay anything for Michelle's service but you are treated like you are only person she is dealing with your that special.

"4","Peyton M.","Does anyone know who you have to bribe at Sanitation to get a blue recycling bin replaced? After destroying our's in the claws of the recycling truck, the city took it away and never replaced it roughly two months ago. My wife put in a request online for a new one maybe a month ago and still nothing. I'd love to get rid of the huge pile of wet cardboard I've accumulated in the interim. Maybe I can take it and dump at the earth day event myself if the city hasn't replaced the bin by April?"

Trash collectors ""SHOULD"" know when it is time to replace a damaged bin (they see these bins every week). Why do we have to still notify Sanitation (and get frustrated to get thru waiting for somebody to respond)?"
"4","Dawn M.","I've had two bins replaced and it's been nothing but smooth and simple Danilo.  I just went online and filled out a ticket.

"5","Joanne C.","The sanitation dept. really needs to change policy regarding deceased animal pickup. Sometimes you are picking up beloved pets that met with unfortunate fates. Despite these pets having tags and/or microchips, you make no attempt to contact the very distressed & distraught owners, leaving them without much needed closure. A new approach needs to be adopted. It would take very little effort to check."
"5","Colleen L.","JoAnne C., I totally agree, the Sanitation Dept. should take the extra few minutes to contact the owners of the dead animals. I am really upset that they don't do this already. I'm going to East Valley Animal Shelter next week to license my newly adopted dog, I'll see what they say about this and how this policy might get changed.  I'll post what I find out."
"5","Joanne C.","Colleen - thank you. I'm interested to hear what you find out."
"5","Ginger M.","That's awful that they don't do that. It's bad enough that they're animal was killed and then not even informing the owner who is then left to wonder what happened.

The person picking up the animal could radio in or call the office and give them the contact info from the tag or microchip and someone in the office could place the call."

"5","Sparky C.","Having most recently lived in the Bay Area I can say that LA Sanitation offers dramatically worse residential  service at about twice the price. Can you believe they don't offer refunds for missed pickups…which happens on a regular basis. Multiple calls to request collection for missed pick-ups are ignored. In other words, they get paid for doing nothing - how do I get into that business?!?"

"5","Joan C.","This morning, one of the trash trucks parked in front of our house for a few minutes while the driver was on the phone, and when he left, there was a huge oil spill on the street.  I contacted Kirkorian's office and was told there was no crew to do cleanup.  I  was told I should pour baking soda on it.  It's a mess - all in front of our house, and continues up the street due to the tires going over it as he left."

I have not had the outside cameras installed yet. It has 8 cameras and recorders."

"5","Albert B.","Maybe I'm just one of the lucky customers or something, but, for what it's worth, LA City Sanitation is my favorite city department. 

Of all the departments in this city that I deal with, it's the one I've personally seen do its job most consistently and professionally. Their crews pick up large items, tree branches, entire trees, old furniture, beds, toilets, oil and other materials. I've seen them come out and replace my garbage bins or repair them on the spot. On schedule, no less. 

It seems to me that their service level goes beyond what I've come to expect from LA city departments in general. 

Personally, I'd be a lot happier with this city if its other departments did their job as well as LA City Sanitation. 

I'm definitely not saying other people's complaints are invalid or trying get into an argument with anyone. I'm just offering my limited perspective, again, for what it's worth. Thanks."
"5","James A.","Other locals may have issues, but great service here. Driver picks up overloaded cans, anything that falls out of truck.  If I have lost of garbage and put it in another colored can and label it 'black' they pick up without issue.  I've put 100's of pounds of concrete and rock in cans, labeled them ""heavy"" or ""concrete"" and never denied pick-up. (these items can damage truck if you try to sneak them in - best to tell the driver somehow). Drivers have grasped and disposed of large cardboard boxes stuffed with garbage when I've asked and taped around the box. Bulk pick-ups hassle free - even when I add more items at curb than I called in.  

Treat them as partners - not servants! Wave. Walk out when you have an overstuffed can and thank/salute them. 

I helped a friend in Castaic using publicly-contracted Bertek services...YUK! Wouldn't pick up extra can, even if I took empty, stuffed it and walked across the street.  Few pieces of wood projecting 2 feet above cover - No Bueno."

I live on the 18000 Block of Roscoe and there is an alley behind me. I wish you would street sweep every Friday as posted. I wish on Tuesday morning your truck picked up ALL the junk in the alley instead of the driver deciding what he is or is not going to pickup. Yeah I know all about calling in for bulky items pickup for Wednesday mornings because I am certain I am the only person who does call in for pickups. When I do call in for pickups I wish you would just let me tell you to pickup all the junk dumped in the alley instead of making separate orders for each address that I have to also go and get. I wish you would permanently remove all those abandoned blue recycle bins from the alley because they all have been sitting where they are for months with trash in them and graffiti all over them. I wish you would put a label on those blue recycle bins of what to put in them and what not to put in them. 
Oh and I wish your drivers could make a log of the blue recycle bins, when they are damaged, have graffiti on them and stuff like that. No one should have to say, ""that's not my job""..."

The area meant to be cleaned Fri. was blocked by trash cans and x-mas trees making that IMPOSSIBLE. I'm getting dizzy just trying to figure it all out!

"8","Marlena B.","For many years now, I've been using Biobags, 13 gallon for the kitchen and 3 gallon for cat litter, they're reasonably priced at vitacost online and  not as durable but it's never been a problem for me. I'm happy to pay 10 cents for a paper bag, not sure why people are so upset about that. Plastic bags end up in the waterways and inside sea animals, this is a great step forward, government actually doing something helpful. There are alternatives to change every habit we have, with a little research and effort. There was a time when markets only used paper bags. Tell your farmers market merchants about biobags, and to stop using plastic ones. Reusable mesh produce bags can be purchased online, I got mine at reuseit.com but they're available everywhere now."
"8","David D.","People who voted for this did not carefully read the legal language. (They were too excited about legalizing marijuana). The money the stores collect for the bags does not go to any environmental concerns, the stores keep it to offset the cost of the bags and if the bags cost less than 10 cents they can keep the rest for profits.

The vaguely worded measure that even mentioned ""funds for the environment: was a BS measure put there by the plastic bags industry to confuse voters and try to get them to vote down the ban."
"8","Sean C.","Ugh!  Drives me crazy.  You can't reuse those paper bags -- I reused every single plastic bag I got.  Few people remember that here in L.A.  when they implemented the ban, they also implemented a new law that sushi chefs had to wear PLASTIC gloves (at least partially negating the effect of the ban).  I think the supermarkets accepted the bag charge in exchange for not opposing the increasing minimum wage.  Now the government wants that money also.  The bag ban has no measurement of success, no review, and no accountability.  You are just supposed to ""believe.""

We have a one party state now with a super majority -- a party that doesn't care about results or accountability -- just intentions and emotions.  Just hope and pray they don't eliminate prop. 13 on a whim (not crazy given the explosion of renters who don't care about property tax)."

I too have been bringing my own bags to the store for years, its really easy and I'm not even from Europe.

Look at the number of bags that were used in a given period of time and at a certain location....for example, compare the number of plastic bags used statewide in the year 2010 in California . Let's say that number was one hundred million...and compare that to now....zero used.

"8","Sara C.","The point about the burden falling primarily on those who are already struggling is a valid one.  I agree that .10 or .20c  per bag may not impact most of us, but there are some people for whom it will add up.

I believe, and I could be wrong on this, but I believe recyclable bags can be paid for with food stamps. If I am wrong, then I would absolutely support amending that, or allowing a distribution of reusable bags to folks who can't buy their own. I consider that a major win/win for my tax money."
"8","Joan Stewart S.","I can't believe some of the comments on this thread whining about not using plastic bags anymore.  Are you THAT ignorant of the effect you have on our environment?

"8","Paul H.","They went after the wrong plastic bags.  The ones from the grocery stores received multiple uses and were responsibly disposed of.  By the way, there is recycling technology that was never implemented.  The bags that caused most of the problem were from fast food restaurants.

Now don't forget your car
http://info.craftechind.com/blog/bid/391683/13-High-Performance-Plastics-Used-in-the-Automotive-Industry

Electronics are primarily plastics.  Phones, binoculars, cameras, iPads, and much more are only possible because plastics allow an affordable motherboard material and housings.

An if plastics were not around the planes would be very heavy and would consume much more fuel (bringing the cost up incredibly). 

Without plastics we would be chopping down more trees, mining for more metals, and live much less prosperously than we have become accustomed.   

If anyone out there is actually living without plastic, please let me know how it's going.  Plastics truly have made life wonderful, convenient, and comfortable.

The only way to imagine life without plastics is to go back to 1850 or earlier.."

"8","Jamie A.","Weird.  I know very few people who used ""single-use"" bags from grocery store.    They were used over and over for stuff until they wore out.   The only thing the ""bag-ban"" accomplished was to force people to buy what they once got for free."
"8","Dan Gogel","Environmental groups opposed having the bag fee go to an environmental fund. That ballot measure was a Trojan horse by plastic bag manufacturers. If it had passed, retailers would have taken a loss, then turned on the law and lobbied to kill it. It's just like recycling cans - add in a little economic incentive and you end up making a bigger impact on the problem.  And you can still buy the recycled plastic bags for 15¢, just not new bags. Frankly they hold up a lot better and far longer than the regular bags which were always pretty flimsy. I can't count the number of times they would snag on something and my groceries would spill out. Now I use the recycled bags for months - they fold well and barely take up any space so you can just keep a couple in your bag or pockets even. So in terms of the poor this actually ends up being a real plus as they are getting a better value for their money (it's not like the old bags were actually free, the cost was just hidden.

For example, the plastic grocery bags are made out of recycled exhaust gases from refineries which would have burned off in the air if the gases were not converted to plastic. As a result the production of that type of plastic requires almost no resources or power to produce and therefore, contributes far less to greenhouse gases than does the production of other types of plastic which require special refining of petroleum to make or of recyclable cloth bags which are produced from cotton picked by children in Africa and India and then shipped to China which uses coal fired electricity to manufacture the bags and then uses petroleum products to ship the cloth bags to the ports and sends them by diesel powered ships to the US."

So, how is it helpful to discourage the use (by charging) of recyclable paper bags?  Also, supermarkets seem to push their use because supermarkets are a low margin business and making 10 cents multiple times over for each shopper is a gold mine, it would seem.

"8","Ed Lantz","Mark M, I do think you are correct that plastic bags are a small percentage of all the plastic waste floating in the oceans. What I've heard from environmentalists, however, is that the bags are particularly harmful because they are easily mistaken for food and, if eaten, can block the digestive system of animals, thereby killing them. And if excreted, the plastic just gets eaten again... for the next 500-1000 years. The ban on plastic bags has been called for by experienced environmentalists who care for these suffering animals. 

With mass extinctions of sea life happening for various reasons - many due to human activity - slight tweaks to our behaviors that help our animal co-inhabitants is the least we can do. I see it as a rational choice, not a ""left-wing emotional over-reaction."" I'd say we really ought to do more - like better waste management. Caring for our planet is not a liberal cause - it is something that benefits us all.  Every bit helps.

Few shoppers stop to consider that disposable plastic bags have a devastating impact on marine animals such as whales, seals, sea birds and turtles. More than 100,000 animals die every year after ingesting or becoming entangled in them. 
Sea Turtles ingest the bags, the plastic blocks their digestive tract and the food that is trapped inside releases gases that render them buoyant, and then the turtle is unable to dive for food, leaving them to a slow death.

It really saddens me to read some of the post here from people who are too busy to take the time out of their Precious life to SAVE a life. 

Those of you who have been to Hawaii. Have you notice how clean the beaches are ? (locals clean up after other people!) 
In fact, we care so much...Hawaii has BAN smoking & vaping on ALL beaches & state parks. Due to inconsiderate people leaving their cigarette butts in the sand & eventually into the ocean.
Plus, who wants to smell disgusting cigarette smoke while enjoying the beauty of the beach & ocean? I don't.

It's really not that hard folks! 
To remember to bring your own bags (cloth bags, Trader Joe's, Gelsons etc) WholeFoods will even credit you .10 cents, if you bring your own bag!
3 bags .30cents, 5 bags .50cents, it adds up!

Please DO your part and Keep Our oceans & Our environment FREE of plastic bags & trash.
Mahalo & much Aloha!

Most of what you hear from environmentalists is anecdotal while scientists rely on actual data.

No one should be proud to be wasteful, or claim this is a partisan issue. Hey, guess what, the majority of voters voted yes on this prop. Was it a vast majority? Nope. But it won. Attacking anyone's political leanings is pointless and makes you sound like a class A jerk. I'm proud to be on the side of caring about my environment, the wildlife, and my neighborhood by eliminating 90% of these plastic bag's usage. I wish other people would realize this issue isn't about their needs, it's about, yep, the environment, the wildlife, their neighborhoods. Is it a perfect solution? No, but it's something. Wishing people could do whatever they wanted is reckless when public health and safety are at risk. Anyway, this is a neighborhood forum, yet the lack of understanding, empathy and the refusal to see anyone else's side but your own is un-neighborly.

We as a City, couldn't force that change but many companies started those environmental best practices on their own.

Then it went to a small square box the same size as the lipstick and now it comes with a sticker over the bottom. 

I think our kids (who have grown up with mandatory recycling) will be the ones who will change things as they enter the workforce. It's my only hope. I also believe they will be the generation to get rid of landfilling once and for all. They care more about the environment than the money. Ultimately it will be up to the 15 City Councilmembers to say no and work with Sanitation, the County, and the Mayor on alternatives.

Seriously, though:  We are expected to believe that NO ONE reuses the plastic bags that we get from grocery stores?????  Or that they all end up in waterways, and/or inside waterfowl (I remember when THAT was a problem with the twist-off rings on pop-top cans and the plastic ring-holders that held so many beach-bound 6-packs together)? Are Californians THAT much more irresponsible with our plastic bags, than the is the rest of the world population???

Years ago, it was demanded that we wrap our garbage, prior to placing it into garbage cans.  Back when I as a homeowner, and responsible for keeping my own refuse containers clean, that made SENSE, and I did it, diligently disposing of trash, wet and dry, in tightly-closed bags THAT I DID NOT OVERFILL, and got FREE, with my groceries (I also remember when 'paper or plastic' referred to more than just the payment method)!

Fast forward, to the land of ""We don't care 'cause if ain't OURS, and somebody else has to clean up behind us.""  We are still told to wrap our garbage, then we watch in frustration as folks rummage through the cans and dumpsters looking for the bottles and cans that keep them just well-off enough that they aren't FORCED into a life of ""REAL"" crime (i.e., burglary, strong-arm robbery), and tearing open the bags that were so carefully tied and placed in the cans...

After watching a neighbor actually pouring cooking oil from a skillet into a plastic garbage can (which of course MELTED, and the resultant mess attracted all manner of crawling insect), I decided that maybe I had been doing it wrong!  

I still use only clumping sand that dries out whatever my cats deposit into their box (and the odor?  Most folks think I am making it up, that I have cats, because they can't smell it), but my days of buying plastic trash bags to use to dispose of stuff that is only going to end up in a landfill...or a garbage barge, bound for the ocean floor...are OVER!

DWP tells me I can place the 'cat clumps' into the green recycle can, with the yard waste, so I do...WITHOUT a bag!  

As for the rest, I mostly have junk mail, torn up so that anyone going through the cans will have to WORK, to find out it was me who did it (just kidding, I really don't care), magazines and catalogs and newspapers.  the 'wet' trash?  Teabags, coffee grounds, vegetable matter and the occasional bone from a piece of chicken...none of which is likely to add anything to the morass that is a constant presence in the bottom of cans used by folks who think it's someone else's job to clean up behind THEM!

Barrett Newkirk, The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun 4:06 p.m. EST January 6, 2014

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — Jamie Norton considered himself an early adopter of reusable shopping bag, keeping them in the trunk of his car so they're on hand whenever he stops for groceries.

But washing the bags wasn't part of the routine.

""If it gets too dirty, I just toss it out,"" Norton, 61, said as he walked out of Jensen's grocery store here with one of his bags full of food. ""I have never washed a reusable bag.""

Research shows the vast majority of shoppers are like Norton. A 2011 study from scientists at the University of Arizona and Loma Linda University found only 3% of shoppers with multi-use bags said they regularly washed them. The same study found bacteria in 99% of bags tested; half carried coliform bacteria while 8% carried E. coli, an indicator of fecal contamination.

""I classify them as pretty dirty things, like the bottom of your shoes,"" said Ryan Sinclair of the Loma Linda University School of Public Health, a co-author of the study.

He is finalizing another study he hopes to publish soon looking at how pathogens spread through grocery stores with the help of reusable bags. The study, conducted at a central California grocery store in early 2013, involved spraying bags with a bacteria not harmful to humans but transported in a similar way to norovirus, a leading cause of gastrointestinal disease linked to more than 19 million illnesses each year in the United States.

The tracer bacteria was detected in high concentrations on shopping carts, at the checkout counter and on food items shoppers had touched but kept on the shelf.

Sinclair said the contamination cycle often began right after shoppers entered the store and placed their bags in the bottom or the baby carrier of a shopping cart, two places notorious for germs.

“I classify them as pretty dirty things, like the bottom of your shoes.”
Ryan Sinclair, Loma Linda University
""The baby carrier portion of the grocery cart is the most contaminated public surface you ever come in contact with,"" he said.

Reusable bags, often given away as event swag or sold for around $1 at grocery stores, are becoming more common, and 69 local bans on the thin, single-use plastic alternatives, have passed in California.

But Sinclair doesn't think habits about washing the bags are changing much in the years since the study he helped create was published.

The researchers found that bacteria thrived and multiplied on bags stored in the trunks of cars and that machine or hand washing reduced bacteria on bags by more than 99.9%. A separate study published in 2012 traced a norovirus outbreak among a girls' soccer team from Oregon to a reusable bag stored in a hotel bathroom used by an ill team member.

Norton, a Palm Springs resident, said the flimsy plastic bags come in handy, especially for cleaning up after his dog, but he supports bans.

""I really do think plastic bags are a blight,"" he said.

A proposed ban here would prohibit most stores from giving out thin plastic shopping bags and instead require them to charge 10 cents for a recycled paper bag. Plastic bags for meat, produce and takeout food still would be allowed, as would heavier plastic bags such as ones often given out at clothing retailers.

A similar ban took effect in Los Angeles on New Year's Day. San Franciso passed its ban in 2007, the first city in the nation to do so.

For their study, Sinclair and other scientists collected bags from shoppers in California and Arizona, offering them a replacement bag or money as compensation and swabbed the bags for any contamination. Shoppers also were questioned about how often they use and wash their bags.

Sinclair recommended that the bags be treated like the dirtiest laundry and washed in hot water with a detergent and disinfectant. He said he puts his own bags in the washer with socks and underwear, and that even the polyurethane bags can be washed five or six times before they start to fall apart.

Putting the bags in the washing machine and dryer about once a week is a good strategy, Sinclair said. Washing with a spray cleaner and cloth isn't effective, he said, because it tends to miss dirt deep in corners and creases.

The study recommended more public awareness efforts about washing reusable bags and that manufacturers print laundering directions on the bags.

Sinclair and other authors faced some criticism after the study was published because the American Chemical Council partially paid for the research. The trade organization has advocated against reusable shopping bags on behalf of its members who manufacture the thinner, petroleum-based plastic bags.

Sinclair said he wasn't aware of the association's support until after the study was published and that the money doesn't discount the finding or recommendations.

""Personally, my recommendation is to use reusable bags, but just wash them. It's not a big deal,"" he said.

At the grocery store, Sinclair recommends that shoppers use cleaning wipes if the store has them available for carts and that foods be washed before going into storage at home. Separate bags also should be used for meats and vegetables.

Betsy Hammes of Palm Springs grabbed a shopping cart outside Jensen's and placed her reusable bag in the bottom. She said she's diligent about washing the bags with a spray cleaner and then throwing them away after a few washings.

Before entering the store, Hammes pulled a disinfectant wipe from the dispenser and cleaned the shopping cart handle.

""I always do that,"" she said. ""You never know who was using it before."""
"8","Maria G.","No one throws away their clothes after a few washings or wearings. It's not that much harder to wash bags than clothing. Or just get a box from the store (like the old days when baggers were called box boys."
"8","Kim T.","I wash mine with my cleaning rags every week and I am SO glad that there are more of you who DO care about the environment and keeping plastic out of Sunshine Canyon than who do not care!"
"8","Bebe Johnson","I'm happy about the ban--it's taken time, but I'm pretty much ""re-trained.""  It's also a good kick in the pants for me to finally get and install a Doggie Doolie.  Finally, I heartily second the recommendation of the Envirosax.  I got one through an organization I joined and I use it to death.  It rolls back up into a small tube, holds massive amounts of (heavy!) stuff and can be machine washed (at least I've done it with no ill effects).  $8 for the solid color ones and I've had mine (and use it heavily-4-6 times per week) for years and only now is the stitching coming loose.  I suspect the shoe repair guy would sew it with heavy duty thread for a couple more bucks.  

And if I forget my bags, I just load my stuff back into the cart and then into the car.  A bit of a pain, but not a deal breaker...."
"8","Jane D.","Germs vs. saving the environment? I've been using reusable since long before the ban and I just wash my hands like I would after touching anything that's not spotless.

"8","Sarah B.","In addition to a reusable bags, I purchased at Costco a couple of thermal insulated cooler carriers that I keep in my trunk. They have a top with a zipper. So in the unlikely event that I forget my reusable bags, I can put one of these carriers in the cart or I can just leave the groceries I purchased in the cart and put them in the carrier when I get to my car. Either way it's really not a very big deal. I do not miss the excessive number of plastic bags that used to blow up into my front yard and patio and sometimes even into the backyard if we've had a wind. I don't miss seeing all the plastic bags blowing up and down Slauson and the residential streets nearby because people were too lazy to discard them properly."
"8","Joyce N.","I dunno, I just read through about half of this thread. I guess I will never understand my fellow voters.  While I can certainly understand banning the plastic bags, what I cannot understand is requiring retailers to charge us for the non plastic bags (if the issue was the plastic bags to begin with).  Retailers had already built the cost of some type of bag into their pricing.  If this fee is not funding some type of environmental cause why are we now paying for bags?  Are paper bags that much more for the retailers to buy?  I think not. There must be a powerful grocers lobby behind this as they seem to be the major beneficiary of this added ""bag fee""  Regardless, my fellow Californian's voted for this so we are stuck with it, for the time being.  I can't wait to see the follow up data on how effective the whole thing is given that we now have to buy that many more plastic bags for the trash that used to go into the now ""banned bags""."

"8","Kenneth M.","I use the bags i get from the store for recyclables.  So now i will just use garbage bags.  But it was nice to have the other bags."
"8","Paul I.","The whole idea is for you not to buy the 10 cent bag in the first place.  Just buy a few of those reusable cloth bags and take them with you go shopping.  Once you get home and empty them just remember to throw in your trunk.  Whats so hard about that?  

I remember a few years ago when L.A. first started to implement this program, I was a little peeved.  Now it's no big deal, it's second nature."
"8","Dj N.","Whenever we go on vacation or somewhere interesting, I try and buy a reusable bag for grocery shopping.  Each time I used it, I'm reminded of that fun afternoon or beautiful scenery.  If anyone needs reusable bags, I extras they can have.  Even though I've been using my own bags for awhile now (I like that I can throw the bag full of groceries over my shoulder - leaving my hands free to unlock the front door and disarm the alarm), I will miss the plastic produce bags, that I place on my countertop to collect my chopping-trash.  My Sister recently purchased a small reusable bin for me that slips over the top of cupboard below the countertop for my chopping-trash, but admittedly I'm struggling to get used to it - I'll get there.  We'll all get there, just a matter of forming new habits."

I have about 30 reusable bags. I wash them in the top rack of my Dishwasher & rotate them. Recycled Produce bags I got years ago. We're doing the right thing with the bags, maybe not our taxes, but definitely environmentally we are ahead of others."
"8","Jane D.","@Joyce N. voters didn't opt for the 10 cent fee. It is the grocery stores that said 'if you're going to take away our cheap plastic bags we need to be compensated' so the fee was a compromise and considering the benefit to our environment, it's a fair price to pay. But yes, the cost of paper bags is much more to the retailer than those flimsy old plastic bags. Also, some stores like Target, are charging the dime for semi-reusable plastic bags that cost way more than the old ones but can be reused several times."

"8","David M.","I read some of the replies under this topic and I can see why now this state is in the trouble that it is in. We have huge problems with our health care system, the mental health system, our transportation system and now the criminal system where these same people I'm sure voted to release ""low risk"" offenders into our streets, leading directly to the large increase in property crimes that is currently plaguing all of us. It is more important that we invite and pay for another country's poor people instead of looking out for our own first. This morning LAUSD is going to spend money on counselors for people who are just too upset by the elections results - where was that money when we needed guidance counselors for our kids at Westchester, among other things? We are racking up billions of dollars of debt each year such that at one point, this State could very easily become bankrupt, or darn near close to it.  And now, we are going to make believe that the plastic bags that all of us use to carry easily purchases we make has become the focus of our fight against pollution. What a load.

Absolutely nothing that has been argued in defense of this absurd notion regarding the plastic bags could possibly be true. Remember styrofoam? Aluminum cans and plastic bottles? And all of the packaging used by either toy manufacturers, electronic and audio manufacturers, which is much larger and more pervasive. What happened to that? Wouldn't that be more of a threat to all that wildlife you want to protect? And the best part is - the solution that is being used is the further rape of our forests (paper bag source), big oil (the manufacturers of the new bags) and the enrichment of the supermarkets (who will be getting something out of that 10 cents, one way or the other). And the little guy, he just gets screwed by another tax imposed by a bunch of self involved, self satisfied and overly hysterical Westside types who latch on to the latest fad movement promulgated by celebrities (Julia Louis Dreyfuss).  This isn't about sacrifice. this is about the meddling of some thinking they know what's best for the rest of us. 

I read somewhere that this kind of political view pretty much much dries up over 30 miles beyond the beach, and that those inland people have a much different view of the world than those that live much closer to the sea. 

On a final note, I would petition to keep the kind of self congratulatory City, Council based propaganda OFF this web page. As you can see, there are very different differences of opinion at large here."

Then a former student, an environmental biologist, reported back after taking samples from the ""East Pacific garbage patch."" The garbage haul, taken from hundreds of miles out in the Pacific, was pretty appalling. So I voted to sustain the ban, and don't regret it. Banning plastic bags doesn't lower our standard of living or pose much more than a minor inconvenience. Instead, it offers a modest but noticeable environmental benefit and (for all you economists out there) successfully addresses one small ""tragedy of the commons."""

"8","Bobbi Z.","Before the ban I always re-used my bags for garbage, crafts, storage, etc. so there was very little waste and a great deal of convenience.
Now there is the inconvenience of bringing your own bags (I often forget them in the car trunk) as well as other unintended consequences:
It takes longer to check out because of the lack of uniformity of the bags.
There has been a HUGE spike in shoplifting,
Unless you wash your re-usable bags there can be salmonella and other germs growing in them.
The 10 cent charge goes directly to the stores, not to environmental causes. 
Overall, I would say the ban does more harm than good and is definitely a huge pain in the ass, as is usually the case with government intervention."

They hold more and are much easier to carry. If you want to go a step further Amazon sells reusable cotton bags for your produce to save even more plastic. We live in a beautiful place.

Show me what grocery store has NO plastic of any kind? Also the reusable bags have to get WASHED or they get gross and bacteria riddled WASHING the ""reusable"" bags requires electricity and WATER to wash!!!  I USED to use the free plastic as potty bags for my dogs.  Now I have to BUY potty bags so another expense. I realize the idea was noble to reduce plastic in the environment.

"8","Jit D.","For those who are unhappy about mandating reusable bags, I grew up in India using reusable bags for all groceries and shopping. Reusable cotton bags was the norm, I never seen a plastic bag for groceries except while shopping for clothing etc. Even these days when I visit my parents, my mom would give three reusable bags, one each for vegetables, fish or meat and flowers (for worship or puja as they call it) with strict instructions bag with flowers not to touch the bag with fish at any time 😊. But these days I also see the proliferation of plastic bags at grocery stores which are a nuisance seemingly everywhere on the streets. Lacking the kind of Western regulations treating plastic bags, I feel a bit sad seeing how plastic bags are damaging the env there. If the US the biggest polluter in the world, doesn't take the lead to set examples for rest of the world how are we going to ask the blooms in China who are just now enjoying the ""fruits"" of modernization to give on the damaging conveniences like plastic bags?"

I wonder, for those of us who oppose, how do we reduce the litter and environmental impact - all those plastic bags lining our trash cans or cleaning up dog poop go to the dump and take anywhere from 20-1000 years to decompose (I just looked that up, whoa!) - without punishing people. Are there other options? Maybe someone would like to set up a canvas bag donation at local grocers? Maybe a school program?

"8","Nicola B.","The whole point is to minimize single use plastic usage. That should also be applied to plastic usage in general. A price tag on a bag should be a deterrent. Don't think of it as the store having an opportunity to take advantage of you, that's the wrong mindset. (The plastic they should be using now, in any case is different, part recycled and multi use). If you have you own bags, you won't need to buy any. Anyone who is opposed to this really hasn't got much excuse. The fact is, this country is a disposable nation. It's a foul habit. It's pretty bad compared to many other countries. Look at the state of our oceans. The landfills. All from take out cups, plates. Fast food, fast to throw. I even know people who use disposable plates etc in their own homes on occasion, to avoid washing dishes. There is a greater picture. I love working with heal the bay because of this.

Vehicles and farmers in adjoining states burning their farm waste (instead of finding ways to recycle) as I understand are the main culprits."
"8","Paul I.","Good job Nicola.
Like I said earlier all you have to do is buy yourself a few of the cloth bags.  There not expensive at all, I think I might have paid  $1.50 each.  If you're too cheap to buy them I'm sure many places are hand them out for free since the rest of state is now required to get on board.  

The thicker plastic bags at the checkout is not meant for one time use.  Your supposed to bringing those with you the next time you go shopping.  But don't buy those or the paper ones either.  All your doing is giving your money to the grocery chain, who's ripping you off in the first place.  First by over charging you on your groceries.  Secondly their cost of the plastic and paper bags is already figured in the cost of goods.  So don't buy the bags at the checkout, if you do your defeating the whole purpose.  

If you're worried that the cloth ones get dirty, then just throw them in the washing machine.  You really don't need to wash them that often because they still have the plastic bags for your produce.  So using those along with a twist-tie for your fruit and veg and nothing comes in contact with the cloth bag.  Besides your going to be washing anything you're going to eat. 

Yes you will now be buying plastic bags for your thash, though those will be going into a landfill and not into a water way or the ocean.  So yes plastic will still be used but, there will less of it in circulation.  If you noticed before the box person would not always fill up the plastic bag all the way up, before starting with another empty bag.  This seems to be especially true at asian markets.  I would sometimes see only a few items per bag.  

Over here in Elysian Valley and Atwater sections of the L.A river where we have trees, reeds and other plants.  After a rain storm you would see plastic bags and other debris caught up in the vegetation.  What doesn't get caught in the trees makes its way to the ocean.  This especially true after the first rain of the season.  It's not until volunteers go into the river and hand pick out the garbage does this section of the L.A river start to look half decent. 

I'll admit when this program was first implemented in L.A city a few year back, I was like oh heck this is going to be a pain in the ass.  And in the very beginning it was, I would forget to put the cloth bags back in my trunk from the last time I went shopping.  Or walk into the store and forgot to bring them in with me.  Now it's a piece of cake, it's second nature.  

So, now that its the law and it its not going to be changed at least not anytime soon.  You might as well quit your crying and get on board.  Get yourself some cloth bags and get on with it.  Whatever you do don't pay extra for bags as you check out.  All your doing is throwing your money away.  If you got money to throw away, throw some this way, or give to a homeless person, or donated to your favorite charity.  But don't give to the store who's ripping you off and taking advantage of you.  Who makes you join their stupid club and have to their club card.  The grocery chains were the first to start this con job.  Trying to make feel good about joining their club and tricking you to think your saving all this money.  When that's the price it should be getting it for in the first place.  The truth is if you don't join then your really getting ripped off big time.  I say get rid of those club cards and just sell it to me for a fair price and be done with it. They try to cut corners wherever they can one is not having enough checkers and box people and your there waiting and waiting.  They've cut the labor back so much that the front person is always in the check stand, so when you have a question there's no one to help you.  Customer service and proper training has gone out the window, corporate  management doesn't care about you as long as their stores show a profit they're happy.  I should know I used to work in that industry for 25 years.  Now I'm forced to shop at two or three different stores to get the quality I used to get at Hughes Markets. 

Cvs is the worst, their idea of customer service is making sure they are saying welcome to Cvs when you first walk in the store.  Their trying to copy how its been done in Japan for years.  The problem is they don't want to pay for someone to stand at the door and be a greeter.  So they are told by upper management that the closest checker to the door to yell it out every time someone walks in.  They never have enough checkers so your stuck in a long line quite offen.  This is not the fault of the employees, they're just trying to make do with the allotment they are given.  Then there's the pharmacy dept, what a joke that is.  I transferred all mine and my mom's scripts to a small mom and pop pharmacy.  What a relief hardly ever is there a line, if there is its one or two people.  Next is the Cvs club card, who monitors what you're buying.  Then prints out coupons for some of those items along with a rewards cash back once a quarter.  The problem is the coupon expiration date is much too soon.  Its always like spend $10 on this product and save $2, and the item cost $8 so you have to buy two of them.  Once again just sell everything for a fair price and get rid of the cards, instead of making us jump through all these hoops.  Bottom line you're getting screwed all the time, so don't screw yourself and pay extra for the bags every time you go shopping. 

So buy the cloth bags and you  might fill a little good that you're helping the environment. 

This issue is minute compared to what we should really be discussed about.  I suggest you watch the National Geographic Channel tonight at 10 pm (wed).  Or copy and paste this into your browser youtube.com/watch?v=brvhCnYvxQQ
If you type it its cap sensitive.  This youtube is season 1 premiere of Years of Living Dangerously and the one on tv tonight I believe is the last episode of season 2.  If you have Spectrum then you can watch all of season 2 OnDemand for free.  Or go to youtube and see some of the past episodes of both seasons 1 and 2.  I  garentee after watching one of these you'll agree this issue is pale in comparison, not to say that this one not important.  This is especially true now that Trump has selected oil tycoon Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state.  So you know he's pro oil and doesn't give a shit about climate change.  Then there's Scott Pruitt for head of the EPA, who is a close ally to the fossil fuel industry and a climate change denialist.  Talk about putting the fox to guard the hen house.  Trump himself said climate change is a hoax.  If he chooses to cancel the Paris Accord, boy oh boy will we look bad to the rest of the world.  The global community looks to us and expects us to take the lead on this matter as we are one of the biggest polluters  This is serious folks, and its not being talked about on mainstream media. This subject should be on the news each and every night.  I must say I  didn't realize how bad the situation was and how fast it has gotten there.  How things are changing faster than it was once predict.   This is the biggest issue of our lifetime."

It's not about being anti American, it's about doing the right thing.  

Yes, America does contribute big time to the rest of the world, but we are also one of the largest contributers to climate change.  There are people in parts of the world that are already having to migrate away from where their ancestors come from.  These people had very little to begin with and now they have nothing.  As one man stated when the rain doesn't come the earth doesn't work.  So after years of drought they now will be forced to leave.  These are simple people with very little who did nothing to contribute to global warming, but are some of the first to suffer from its ill  effects.

While the US provides aid to other countries that also help the US industries or farm sector as often times the conditions are to use the aid money to purchase US goods and services, moreover aid is a good way to advance US influence and project soft power. It is also true that the US produces largest per capita pollution in the world which hurts people in the US as well as those in other countries. While the US has the means to deter the effects of pollution people in the poorer countries do not. When global warming raises temperature people in the US can afford to use AC to stay nice and comfortable but alas a lot of people in the developing countries can not afford such luxury.When global warming causes drought the US can still manage with expensive alternate means but the counterparts in poorer regions die due to lack of water and food due to loss of farm output. For me the biggest danger I see with the next admin, is the tendency to deny global warming and the nomination of the candidates who are insensitive to environmental concerns in cabinet or govt positions whose policies can inflict great damage to the environment, natural resources and nullify he good work done by the outgoing admin in those areas."

The dime charge is meant to discourage you from buying the plastic or the paper bag. The fee is not meant to be an additional source of income for the store.

"8","Mary P.","I've been using my own bags for a decade or longer, and I'm proud to say I remember them 98% of the time. But on the rare occasion that I'm caught without a bag, I'm still opposed to being price gouged on a bag and refuse to pay for it unless the money is going to a cause which actually makes an impact beyond just adding an extra revenue stream to the stores that used to show their appreciation for the privilege of my patronage by providing a free paper bag as a courtesy for all the money I've spent with them. They've already started trying to coerce us into ringing and bagging our own groceries (job killer... if they're saving money on the staff that they're not paying, I at least want a discount for doing it myself!!) ... what's next? 

Ultimately, I am in agreement with the fact that as a society, there is far too much waste and not enough responsible ecological behavior to mitigate it. But I believe there are far better ways to address it than this so-called bag ban. In reality, its not a real ""ban"" at all, and it does little to make a significant impact -- the same people who brought their own bags, will continue to... the same people who didn't bring their own probably still won't, they'll just pay extra for the bag (or buy less stuff). A small number of people might start to use their own bags, but will also start purchasing heavier trash bags instead of recycling the thinner ""single use"" ones... the overall environmental impact will be minimal at best with the program in it's current form.  Honestly, even in L.A. where the bag ban has been in place for a couple years, I would still find myself being among a very small percentage that actually brought their own bag.  Most people simply paid for the bag (I guess the inconvenience of paying for one was easier than the inconvenience of bringing your own for a lot of people) I noticed very little impact on the plastic bag problem because they were still being used by many stores all over L.A..  

For better impact... How about trying something that we already know makes a difference, like making that dime similar to a CRV like you see on bottles and cans to encourage people to bring them back for recycling or re-use? I rarely see aluminum cans laying undisturbed in the street because there is a financial incentive for people to pick them up and cash them in. If I have to pay a dime for the bag, I'd be happier knowing that money, even if it's only a portion, like a nickel, would be used to reward the person who brought it back for recycling.  Of course, always continue to encourage people to use their own bag... maybe even possibly offering ""bag credits"" to loyal customers who always use their own bag, so on those rare times they find themselves without one, or needing an extra, they can exchange all those credits they've earned from bring their own bags for the occasional free bag when needed.  Reward good customers, especially those who reduce their bag consumption and I'll bet there will be greater participation, and broader acceptance of the program.

If the money went to a good, environmental cause, No problem, I'll drop a dime on that. If the bags were made from hemp paper (rather than trees) I'm fine with the extra cost because it could start to move us away from lumber paper toward more sustainable, eco-friendly paper solutions. If their ""heavy"" plastic bags were biodegradable I'd be OK with that too... but in my view, the ""single use"" were just as re-usable as the heavier ones they sell you now. The problem with these so called ""re-usable"" plastic bags is that people who were tossing the ""single use"" ones out are throwing the heavier ones out too, so they still end up in landfill but now just take longer to degrade. 

But without some kind of benefit from the fees being collected, like the examples above, or something better... it feels like nothing more than another money grab, and there will STILL be too many plastic bags out there that won't biodegrade, because they're not mandated to.

I'm all for environmental responsibility, but I can see why this particular program has many people feeling that its just a misguided and ineffective consumer tax disguised as a weak attempt at ridding the plastic problem, but it does nothing even close to serving that mission unless the funds collected are put to good use. 

On those rare occasions when I had a basket of goods but no bag... I usually end up simply buying significantly less than I would have, which can't be good for retail if the loss of sales becomes widespread by an increasingly large group of people that oppose (or actively protest) being penalized (nickel/dimed) instead of incentivized (CRV) to reduce their disposable bag use."
"8","Sarah B.","To your point both Ralphs and Sprouts give bag credits. Sprouts actually gives you a nickel back for each bag you bring. So does Target"
"8","Paul I.","Yes those stores do give bag credits, which is a start.

What I would like to see is all the chain stores follow this practice.  With the credit given out increased to say 50 cents for each bag you bring in, a nickel doesn't cut it.  You have to make so that people feel like they're missing out, then you'll start to see way more people using reusable bags.  The problem with that is the greedy stores will probably make it up somewhere else.  Even still I  believe this type of program where your rewarded for doing the right thing could really take off.  Its just that the incentive needs to be greater."
"8","Nell P.","I think Whole Foods gives you a dime for bringing bags"
"8","Nell P.","I voted against it cos we ALWAYS recycle bags since they started doing plastic!  Can't stand voters who impose on most of us who recycle, etc."

Every time it rains I call and someone does get sent out to inspect/repair and every time they tell us it is a bigger job than they can handle. I have called no less than 4 times during 4 different rains and it's still not fixed. If it rains as predicted, I guarantee that my street will flood, covering the entire street from one side to other and filling all the driveway aprons of half the block.How can this be fixed?"

"9","Walter U.","To me a greater concern is that a storm drain catch basin is desperately needed at the intersection of Lankershim Blvd and Oxnard St.
Along the section between the existing catch basins, at Lankershim and Victory and the next one approximately a mile away at Lankershim and Burbank Blvd.
This intersection floods out regularly, even in a moderate rain as. the crossover basins on Oxnard become overloaded and the gutter on the south west side of Oxnard is graded to divert water to Lankershim. 
Due to all this, Lankershim Vlvd. sidewalks south of Oxnard become flooded especially between  Collins St and Bu rbank Blvd. even when the catch basin at Burbank is free of debris.
This is a major concern as there are 4 LA Metro bus lines that have to cross this intersection not to mention numerous school busses."

"9","Randy C.","One more reminder. Clean up leaves in the street before the rain, preferably with a broom. Compost the leaves or put them in the green can for the City to compost.

This helps prevent catch basins from clogging and it helps keep the ocean healthy. Too much organic matter in runoff can lead to algae blooms, followed by red tides when the algae dies, falls to the bottom, depletes the oxygen, and causes fish and bottom dwellers to die. This used to happen much more frequently and let's all help prevent it."

"10","Monica O.","What happens if our neighbors garbages were knocked over from the rain flow last night, and now garbage is all over the street?"
"10","Heather N.","Thieves can learn a lot about someone from their trash. 
If you're out of town, you will have less trash in the can. 
If you put out expensive TV boxes, they may break in your home to get them.
If you throw away Christmas gift trash/boxes, they are watching that as well. 
Receipts, credit card statements, mail. 

Trash pickers should always be chased away in my opinion. Plus, they rip open the trash bags and let all of the trash loose in the can. They may also be casing your home to see when you're there and when you're not, as innocent as they may seem."
"10","LA Sanitation","Scavenging (removing items from a trash or recycling bin) is illegal in Los Angeles, punishable with a $500 fine and/or six months in jail. Please report the scavenging to the Bureau of Street Services and/or LAPD. LA Sanitation staff is not authorized or trained for enforcement.

Our collection drivers are instructed not to engage scavengers for safety reasons; scavenger behavior is unpredictable and could turn violent. We advise residents not to engage with them either.

Here are some recommendations:
1.  Keep the blue recycling bin in the garage or other secure area on non-collection days.
2.  Wait until the morning of collection day to put the blue bin at the curb.
3.  Place glass and aluminum recyclables at the bottom of the bin, underneath paper and cardboard.
4.  Do not confront individual scavengers. Instead, observe and report scavengers to the Bureau of Street Services Investigation & Enforcement by dialing 3-1-1.
5.  Do not confront scavenging crews. Instead, observe and report crews with large trucks and/or vehicles to the neighborhood’s LAPD senior lead officers. License plate numbers and photos are always helpful, IF you can take them discreetly.
6.  Work with local councilmember’s district office in consultation with the neighborhood’s LAPD senior lead officers. The more people who campaign for this, the more likely a response.

Regarding cardboard boxes, please break them down and bundle them with twine, then place in your blue bin or leave them on the curb on your collection day. This makes logos and other markings less visible to others. It also makes collection easier."
"10","LA Sanitation","Peter and Jennifer, LA Sanitation doesn't handle parking issues or street sweeping. Please contact the Bureau of Street Services for assistance at bss.boss@lacity.org or 800-996-2489."
"10","Heather N.","The senior lead officers and LAPD don't have enough cops to come out and catch a trash scavenger, even if the city councilman asks them to patrol more. If it comes down to someone being stabbed or a domestic violence call -or a trash scavenger.... So, who else can come and enforce this? and, how would they be there at the exact moment the scavenger appears? Our prosecutors don't even throw thieves in jail these days, I find it hard to believe they will jail a scavenger or fine them even if they could catch them. I'd be interested to hear some other realistic options as to how Dept of Sanitation can enforce this."
"10","LA Sanitation","Monica O, this unfortunately happens alot when it rains. It helps to place bins away from the curb or on the curb during rain events. Please call our 24-hour Customer Care Center at 1-800-773-2489 with the address. They will gladly send a crew to clean up the mess."

CITY OF LOS ANGELES OFFICIALS LAUNCH 2016 CHRISTMAS TREE RECYCLING PROGRAM

LOS ANGELES (December 22, 2016) – Tis the season, and the City of Los Angeles today launched its 2016 Christmas Tree Recycling Program at the North Central Sanitation District Yard, where they provided tree recycling demonstrations and important fire safety tips.

LA Sanitation, the city bureau that oversees the program, annually provides residents with three safe and environmentally friendly options for Christmas tree recycling. Last year, nearly 100,000 trees were recycled, creating mulch and compost used by residents for gardening and City staff for landscaping. The three recycling options are:

1)     Green Bin: residents are urged to follow a three-step process to recycle their trees in their green bin:

     A)     Remove all ornaments, decorations, tinsels and stand from the tree

     B)     Cut the tree into pieces; and

     C)     Place the tree pieces in the green bin and put out on your weekly collection day.

2)     Curbside: Residents unable to cut or place trees in the green bin may leave their tree at the curb on their weekly collection day.

3)     Drop-off:

Residents can drop off their tree for recycling at one of 12 Los Angeles City Fire Stations.

Residents can drop trees at one of two mulching facilities: Lopez Canyon Environmental and Education Center (11950 Lopez Canyon Road, Sylmar, CA) or the Harbor District Yard (1400 North Gaffey Street, San Pedro) weekdays from 9:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m.

Finally, residents can go to one of six City Recreation and Park locations on Sunday, January 8, 2017 from 9:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m.

Go to www.lacitysan.org/treerecycle or call our 24-hour Customer Care Center at 1-800-773-2489 for locations. 

Residents of multifamily buildings are requested to place their Christmas trees curbside on their neighborhood collection day. For collection day information, go to www.lacitysan.org or call 1-800-773-2489.

Holiday wrapping paper, cartons, cardboard, Styrofoam® and other expanded polystyrene products, plastics and gift boxes are also recyclable and should be placed in the blue bin. Residents are reminded, however, that it is illegal to place household hazardous waste, such as electronics (i.e. televisions and computers) and batteries into the collection bins. Residents are urged to take those items to one of seven S.A.F.E. Centers for safe disposal and recycling. Go to www.lacitysan.org for locations and times."
"10","Lisa K.","We have a neighbor who came up with a great idea to deter recycling scavengers that involved drilling two holes in the top and lip of the container, then using a lock to secure it. Is this okay to do or would someone be charged for damaging the can? Thanks."
"10","Heather N.","I did that Lisa and it's been a few years and Sanitation hasn't busted me yet. ;-)"
"10","Lisa K.","Awesome Heather!!"
"10","Arthur A.","What's the problem with the ""scavengers""?"
"10","Heather N.","1, for some of us they come onto our private property to get to our cans
2, we have no idea if they are also looking for documents to steal our identity
and 3, they rip open the trash bags letting all of our trash loose inside the trash bins-sometimes it's a leaky mess, and other times the trash flies up into the air and onto the street when the trucks empty them. 
Plus, as Dept of Sanitation noted in this thread, it is illegal."
"10","Sara S.","Thanks LA Sanitation!! I'm impressed with the communication and it really helps to know about these changes. Thank you and happy holidays!!!!"
"10","James A.","LAPD responding to a call for trash can scavengers? That is hilarious!!! I'm going to guess the total number of arrests in 2016 for this crime.......in the entire city......was about........ZERO!"
"10","Jerry B.","I couldn't agree with you more
 This is another classic example of a law, actually on the books that no one enforces. We have people that actually drive through our neighborhood, scavenging the blue barrels, and going through the others. There is someone who drives a pickup truck and scavenged scrap metal. I feel sorry for some of them as I have seen people with children doing this on occasion and very possibly they actually need the glass, plastic, aluminum  etc. The point is it is still illegal. Willing to bet that if our assigned LAPD Officers witnessed this they wouldn't do anything, or would act as though they had seen nothing."
"10","Peter M.","LA Sanitation: Why can't your department and Bureau of Street Services ""get together"" and work these parking/trash problems out!?! Sort of like the CIA and the FBI?  I'm glad to see the Sanitation Dept. on here, giving us updates, but please people, remember we pay some of the highest trash collection rates in the country, and it's the single-family-home owners who seem to pay the most. I'm told it helps fund LA police and fire service. Also, I notice many of my neighbors put-out great-big containers that have a handful of garden cuttings, and maybe a few small boxes in the recycle bin, I try and put mine out when they're FULL, a lot better for our environment on many levels, and frees-up parking as well. AND: while I'm on topic: PLEASE DO NOT put-out, or have others put-out: containers until AFTER your designated street-cleaning time is up. The trucks have to go around the containers in the street leaving it uncleaned,  totally defeating our complicated parking issues."
"10","Cheryl B.","There hasnt been a street cleaner on my street in 10yrs. Take the street cleaning signs down or start cleaning the streets"
"10","Heather N.","Peter, if you have neighbors that put the cans out way too early or leave them there beyond trash day, you can call enforcement and they will cite them. If the neighbor doesn't stop then the city will take the cans away completely from them. I used to have a neighbor that left the cans out 24/7 and in front of my property instead of theirs. This enforcement division was very helpful.

"10","Geraldine S.","I have had one or more trash bins missed on my regular pick up days on many occasions over the years. I have called to report the missed pick up to LA Sanitation . They tell me to leave it out and it will be picked up before my next regular pickup day. Not one time has that ever happened. They NEVER come back to pick up a missed bin. And i have made that call at least 10 times!"

"10","Jacquelyn T.","As one who finds JOY in 'proper' grammar, but has some serious issues with TYPING, especially when my place is COLD (as it is, right now, as well as damp!) I try to cut as much slack to others as possible (that may or may not make sense, I am delirious from LACK OF SLEEP due to a roof leak that took over my ceiling and closet and kitchen cabinets, oh, my!)...I am waiting for the landlord, who left a few hours ago, to return with the proper equipment that will make it possible to remove water from my SOAKED carpet (wet/dry vac, anyone???); in the meantime, I entertain myself by working on my computer so I can hear his knock at the door, since the DOORBELLS have SHORTED OUT with the torrential rainfall and high winds that forced water into the panels that, for a few brief, shining weeks, actually WORKED!

We are now back to hoping that FedEx and UPS will knock on my windows (I am in the front of the building, on the ground floor) so we don't have to go chasing all over the place or, even worse, have our packages stolen because someone is watching for them to be left outside of places where most folks are at work, during the day..."
"10","John B.","If fats, oils, grease, clog pipes,  what do they do to our  arteries? They need to bake and or boil? Stop frying? They say, ""Don't want no chicken baked or boiled give me that chicken fried in oil"". before- the-abuse. com"
"10","Jacquelyn T.","Fats and oils vs. arteries...let's forget, for a moment, that arteries are living FLESH and to a certain extent able to defend themselves...thanks John B. for this lovely apples to coconuts comparison between body parts and sewer lines, many of which are PVC pipe (in properties where there have been updated plumbing systems installed) or even COPPER!  

The point of that particular advice is to keep the water/sewage systems clean and clear so that when the wastewater is RECYCLED, there is one less step that needs to be done...or, in the case of those all-too-common raw-sewage leaks, the environment suffers just a LITTLE BIT less because those pesky non-biodegradable phosphate detergents are not used to break down the fats.as they go down the drain...

Remembering back to the days when just about ANYTHING could be, and DID, get flushed down those lead-pipe water-hog toilets...if there were no bones, it got handled!  Now, in the era of low-flush, wimpy pipes, some folks simply (HORRORS!!!) pour their used grease into the BLACK CANS, where they stink up the world (but, since the culprits usually don't live downwind of the stench, they don't care...even when the HOT grease burns a hole in the plastic cans, and gunk runs out onto the concrete...

I dream of a world where everyone is responsible for cleaning up after him/herself, and takes that responsibility seriously; in the meantime, I do wish that the blue cans that SHOULD be used for recycling cans and bottles would be made available to those of us in apartment complexes who want to do the right thing, instead of having to wonder why greedy landowners keep locking the blue cans up, and using them to dispose of construction debris..."

"10","Regan K.","If you need help getting a service from the city of Los Angeles call 311 or go to the website ""MyLA311. They even have an app you can download!

"10","Peter M.","Does anyone know if LA DOT issued any $75 ""street cleaning day"" parking tickets today,Friday? Because of the Christmas holiday (and this will happen again for New Year's) our collection was delayed til Friday, which is ALSO a ""street cleaning day"", (not sure why these cleaning trucks even go-out in pouring rain, but that's another kettle of fish,) but: the side of the street we can't park-on was TOTALLY blocked by trash containers making it impossible for the trucks to do any cleaning, but really creating a parking HELL for a lot of us!"
"10","Bonnie P.","You get street cleaning?! We haven't had any for years and years up in the hills."
"10","Kelly's Barbecue","I hope the off days were used for target practice.  LOL!  This is a standard occurrence on our street, unfortunately."
"10","Jacquelyn T.","No street cleaning in the hills because 1) unless non-residents drive up and toss their trash out of car windows, there is no need to clean the streets and 2) the wind can usually be counted upon to blow the trash OFF the hills/Down the hills...and, at the risk of pissing off some of my new-found friends, TARGET PRACTICE?!?!?!

Ohhhh...I get it..for killing coyotes, right?"

"10","Heather N.","Call the customer service number on your bill. Complaining here is pointless.

I can't believe the skirmishes: the vitriol.  You really can't read it anymore."
"14","Barbara Pflaumer","Agreed the OC is horrid"
"15","Lois Arkin","If neighbors could kindly advocate for the developer to market the units  to people who want to live car free, problem is solved, and developer could be sure to include affordable housing for the money they are saving on not building the parking.  Being that this location is within walking distance of two subway stops and 10 or 15 buslines, a radical reduction in parking spaces is what is called for, along with restricting rental to car-free residents with annual certifications for living car-free!"
"15","Richard Bourne","It being a quarter mile from the subway, I would actually rather see less parking so less cars end up clogging the streets.  

The site can build 15 units by right, or 21 with the density bonus which would require 2-3 'affordable units' subsided by the market rate units.  What easements has the project asked for, looks like a by right development.

As for 'Lawn Park"" blame the city council that seems to think that is an acceptable idea and has legalized it.  Public street parking is a limited resource and should be restricted and priced fairly.  Implement a paid residential parking scheme and watch the problem and traffic go away overnight."
"15","Nicolas hernandez","How can I have more information?"
"15","Matt Stauffer","90 percent of new households in Los Angeles are low and no car. We need to start allowing developers to cater to this market and buildings near transit are the best place. I live 0.7 miles from two subway stops. If I were only 0.25 miles away I'd be in heaven.

"15","Rusty Millar","what did your neighborhood council say on the project?  what did the immediate neighbors say on the project?  what support through the neighborhood council did they get?"
"15","Lisa Derrick","Yes, you are correct: They have the density bonus, with two of the 21 units being very low income affordable (and those units get one parking space not matter how many bedrooms).  They are following the city mandated 11% of units being registered as affordable in exchange for high density. The developer was able to gain an extra 9 feet 11 inches in height (basically another story) with those two low income units.  

The lawn parking is the result of an ADA compliance lawsuit that basically pleads that there is not enough handicapped parking and handicap access to sidewalks, so until the city is 100% compliant, anybody can park on public lawns (oddly it is illegal to park on your own private lawn!). 

This new building averages 1.47 parking spaces per unit, with no accommodations for guest parking. I have yet to see half a car driving around--or parked on a lawn, so the overflow will end up parked on lawns.

Ideally public transportation would take care of all our transportation needs; however some work locations can't be easily reached by bus/train combos, or the public transport take twice as long as driving.  People also use cars for multiple errands, visiting people, going on outings.

Less parking will not equal less cars--it will mean more cars taking street parking spaces, and more cars driving around looking for parking. Two spaces per one and two bedrooms; three for three bedrooms would allow for couples/roommates who have two cars, and could also mitigate street parking problems, with people renting out an extra parking space."
"15","Matt Stauffer","More parking will not equal fewer cars--it will ensure that everyone who moves to the neighborhood brings a car with them, making traffic congestion worse. There is also no guarantee that an apartment with two parking spaces will only have two cars. Plenty of the cars parked on the street are second and third cars. As long as street parking remains free, there is no disincentive for people to use every available space. Better to manage street parking through neighborhood permits, and give the car-less a place to live without having to pay for parking they won't use. Then a private operator can open a monthly garage to take in any spillover.

Also, parking destroys neighborhoods. Neighborhoods get their character and integrity from the buildings in them, not from parking lots. We need more housing in this city, not more parking.

There were no cameras?

Long story short, there were a LOT of transients in the area, because many Ventura Blvd. businesses closed after the Northridge quake, and although there were a lot of boarded-up places, there was still a lot of room for someone to hide or lie in wait!

Is there a website where an ordinary person can look at the location as it did, back then, and compare it to the way it looks, now?  15 years ago, we did not have the world at our fingertips...the internet has definitely changed the way we see the world, and not all of that is a bad thing.  

Now that I am not quite as 'speedy' as I used to be, I take extra precautions, and can very seldom afford myself the luxury of 'sauntering along'...unless I am with a group of people, I put some pep in my step, and am constantly scanning as I move.

In fact, they saved me the hassle of throwing out my broken CD player. ☺ But still, I was surprised at how much it upset me for days afterward and how I wished I could have caught them in the act, even though I knew they had to be just some kids (the window they entered thru was so ridiculously small).  I think break-ins just have that effect on us, at least for a while.

As an aside, I would advise against actually attempting a citizens arrest.  I don't really know the statutes but I believe they are actually considered to be pretty fraught territory, legally-speaking.  More importantly, a physical escalation is never a good idea.  Not that I've never been in a fight (thanks to angry drunks) but with the spectrum of mental, sensory, and physical conditions folks can have, conflicts can be a lot more complicated than you realize at the time, and confrontation is best avoided. The truth of it is  you completely protected your neighbors mail (and identity information) while getting a detailed description.  So what you did was a total success!

On the other hand, zoos have been instrumental in the study and care of animals on the brink of extinction and have been places where they have been able to learn much about these precious creatures and ways to help them survive. If they are considering the creation of areas that are similar to natural habitats, move more toward a sanctuary concept where human visitors would be the ones who are enclosed as they move through the area and their admission fees can help to support the work that is done to help the survival of orphaned, injured and mistreated creatures and studies that can help species survive, that might be something to consider.

Some of these remarks have got me down. If you visited the zoo, you would know that the zoo professionals are experts on breeding small populations of endangered species. The knowledge and advances they gain there helps scientists working with populations in the wild. Our zoo in particular plays a major roll in monitoring and maintaining the populations of critically endangered California Condors that have been re-established in the wild (just one example).

Many children grow up eating animals, hunting wildlife, abusing animals, make a career out of experimenting and torturing anaimls in the name of unnecessary scientific advancement, never thoughtful about how to co exist with animals.

"40","Ali K.","I'm happy to see that the majority on here is against Zoo's, Sea World, circuses etc...those animals belong in their own habitat where they can roam freely. Not in a small cage, alone (away from their own kine), no exercise. Tigers and lions have around 18,000 times less space in zoos than they would in the wild. Polar bears have one million times less space. Lions in zoos spend 48% of their time pacing, a recognised sign of behavioural problems. African elephants in the wild live more than three times as long as those kept in zoos We humans need to respect the lively hood of all animals. They do not belong in a Zoo, even if they are being cared by the zoo keepers. 
Here is a great article not to be ignored or dismissed.
Open your eyes...these animals suffer from those who keep supporting zoos. Animals that are held in captivity for one's own benefit. 
Very sad in deed. ;'(

"40","Carol S.","A good friend is a docent. I am ver impressed by the dedication these highly educated volunteers bring to their positions. They teach thousands of school children every year about the animals and the need to preserve their habitats. These students have an experience that can last a lifetime."
"40","Patty M.","So, I guess everyone who is boycotting the zoo is fine with extinction? If it weren't for the efforts of the la zoo, we wouldn't have California condors or pronghorns anymore, just to name two species. It's all well and good to say ""animals should live in the wild (which I believe as well),"" but the sad reality is that many of these species would go extinct without the conservation efforts and species survival plans of good zoos. Also, zoos no longer go out and catch wild animals unless needed (for instance, the aforementioned condors.) These are animals that were bred in various zoological facilities in such a way as to keep as large a genetic diversity as possible. Not all zoos are good, but the LA zoo certainly is. I don't think most people realize all the background work they are doing. It's not just ""animals in cages for our amusement."""
"40","Dorit T.","I agree with keeping animals in captivity is not ideal at all and I am not an expert but I see that the animals are safe from environmental danger such as hunting, poaching and people in general. When I was a child I went to the zoo a lot and it was one of my favorite things to do. I learned so much about them and my awareness grew. I hope this is still the case for kids in our world today that need to be exposed to the amazing creatures that live with us on this beautiful planet."
"40","Andrew H.","Hundreds of thousands of children visit zoos every day and many build a lifelong connection with animals as a result thereof.  That's not going to happen in sanctuaries in which one will be lucky if they ever see an animal.  It's important that children have zoos so they can develop an empathy and knowledge of the plight of some of these animals in the real world.  Hopefully, many of them will grow up and support conservation and protection efforts for the animals.  For example, my daughter loves Okapi's and knows and feels sadness that they are an endangered animal.  She would have no idea about this animal if she didn't see and learn about it at a zoo.  Yes, we need sanctuaries but we also need zoos - better zoos with larger enclosures.  Yes, it's far from ideal for the specific animals in the zoo (although many of them have already exceed their expected life span if left in the wild) but I do think the exposure of these animals to millions of people a day does help the plight of their brothers and sisters in the wild.

Lastly, some of my and my children's favorite memories were of visits to the zoo. Let's not forget the excitement and joy of children as they run from animal to animal."

"40","Verna V.","I've been to Kenya to meet with a scientist who's been conducting the longest running study of elephants in the wild for 44 years -dr Cynthia moss. I've read her book as well as books by dr Joyce Poole, and sir Ian Douglas Hamilton. The LA zoos record with elephant deaths is terrible as are all zoos. None of them live their natural life span at the LA zoo. The LA zoo has been found to be training the elephants with illegal bull hooks and electric shock. A judge has ordered them to stop. I no longer can visit any zoo that has elephants. They can not be kept humanly in captivity - http://www.lcanimal.org/index.php/campaigns/elephants/la-zoo"
"40","Patty M.","To the people talking about ""animals in small spaces,"" and the natural habitat sizes... you do realize that the reason certain animals have large habitat sizes and small population densities in the wild tends to be because they require that much room to meet their nutritional needs, right?  They aren't spending all day roaming because it's fun, or they like to sight-see. They need that amount of space for grazing/finding prey/etc. If you take two animals of the same species, one in an environment rich in needed resources, one in a resource poor environment, the first animal will have a drastically reduced territory comparatively. Because a zoo meets their food needs, they don't necessarily require the space they might in the wild. As long as the zoo is also focusing on enrichment to give the animal mental stimulus/the ability to practice wild behaviors (and the la zoo does this), the tiger or whatever is not actually being harmed by not having to spend many hours a day searching a large area for prey. Domestic cats have much larger territories when they are feral than when they live in your home/apartment. Are you being cruel by keeping your cat at home, safe and well fed? PETA thinks so (and wants to ban people having pets) but most people do not."
"40","Verna V.","Oh and all of this nonsense about children needing to visit zoos and this will somehow magically protect them in the wild.... zoos have existed for over 100 years and yet animals that are in zoos that these children have been seeing for 100 years are ALL going extinct! So how's that empathy working and when is it going to kick in? We're loosing non human species At 10000 times the natural rate of 1-5 species a year. Dozens A DAY ARE GONE. How many parents leave any zoo and go home and online and give money to protect animals in the wild? Andrew how much do you give to protect endangered species in the wild a year? Just curious. Is this something you explain to your children - how these animals got to the zoo? Do you even know how they got to the zoo? Their parents were shot in the wild is how. How many tigers and giraffe put their babies on an airplane to go to the big city and live in a zoo? If I hear this ""but my children like it"" and it will save them in the wild (magically) one more time my head will explode! ITS NOT WORKING ! I gotta stop reading idiotic posts"
"40","Petra B.","Thanks Verna!"
"40","Song T.","People who say that there is nothing wrong and the wild animals are not harmed and it's ok to keep them in zoos should spend some time in cages without ever being able to leave. Have some food thrown at them, have people stare at them... and of course doing tricks are extra special."
"40","Madeline G.","I LOVE that everyone posting here cares deeply about animals, regardless of their opinion about zoos.  I am conflicted myself about zoos but do believe that ""good"" zoos are a good thing for many of the above mentioned reasons.  Good zoos provide adequate space, excellent veterinary care, species appropriate diets and enrichment.  The animals living in these conditions have a pretty nice life when compared with life in the wild where they face starvation, predators, hunting etc.  Bad zoos are an abomination and there are way too many of them still out there but the LA Zoo is not one of them.  I believe it deserves our support so it can continue with conservation efforts that are so desperately needed for the wildlife."
"40","Andrew H.","Verna, I know what you mean.  It's like when I see people spelling losing ""loosing"".  It drives me freaking crazy.  See, when you hypothesize that something isn't working such as educating millions of people to the plight of animals and assume that the education isn't resulting in any positive actions by communities and governments then you just seem rather ignorant.  Have you ever heard of Save the Whales?  Did that help stop whaling or have no effect?.  How about the banning of DDT to save the bald eagle?  Elephant tusks?  Anything?  For you to make that hypothesis, you would need to know how many animals/species would have been eliminated if there were no zoos or education programs.  But neither you nor I know that so one can only make a reasonable guess that it would have been more, not less.  And, no, I don't explain to my five year old how the animals got into the zoo, although many of them got there through breeding programs that increase, not decrease the numbers of endangered and threatened animals.  And please don't put words in my mouth or exaggerate what I write as that just seems rather silly.  Such an angry woman, you must be a barrel of laughs for your kids."
"40","Michael B.","LA zoo sucks. I know from personal experience as several friends including a very saavy Encino lawyer has been trying to get LA CITY to release Billy the elephant to a sanctuary. The zoo through the city attorneys fought it. It was proven however through Encino Attorney( I was in court and watched much of the cross examination of the vet and the exec director, that the zoo was abusive in many ways to Billy who is growing steadily mad. I have the court transcripts if anyone is interested. The city lost it's bid to continue mistreating Billy and is now appealing the judge's wise decision to treat him humanely, and provide him with a healthy environment and more. The truth is ugly. Also, according to the zoo director, the new rain forest exhibit will have no room for the leopard, which is a rain forest inhabitant, that has been living in a tiny exhibit cage for years and will die there. He suffers, like BIlly from Zoochosis. He paces back and forth, while Billy sways and bobs his head. It's called going crazy. I would love to be at that meeting.Clicked on the site but nothing happened.

"40","Patty M.","Verna v... zoos have been around for thousands of years, not ""over a hundred"", and they were terrible for the majority of the time. Aza accredited zoos are not bad. Also, they don't go out and catch wild animals except in very specific circumstances, such as capturing the few remaining California condors in order to create a breeding system and reintroduce them to the wild (which they've done). Wild caught animals in the zoo are usually there as a result of seizures of illegally imported animals. Such as billy the elephant at the la zoo, or many of their reptiles. Have you, personally, done even a fraction of what the zoo has done for endangered animals? Do you even check your food products for palm oil before you buy? Or are you just sitting on your high horse?"
"40","Patty M.","Michael b... the zoo doesn't have leopards, they have snow leopards. Clearly, not a rain forest animal. I assume you're talking about the jaguars? Which have wonderful new enclosures? It seems like you may not know what you're talking about."

"40","Lynn L.","First of all, zoos shouldn't be lumped in with circuses or any other venue with performing animals. Animals are not in zoos for human entertainment, but for conservation efforts and education.

The true problem is illicit exotic animal trade, which is the third largest source of illegal profits after drugs and weapons. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 30,000 captive carnivores live OUTSIDE the zoo system. An estimated 4,000 tigers are kept as ""pets"" in private homes in Texas - more tigers than exist in the wild throughout the world. Most of the animals in sanctuaries are rescues from those situations."

The peace, serenity, information, education, and, yes, even the entertainment of certain species (and the merry-do-round) are all excellent benefits.  For those who aren't aware of this or can't/haven't seen it, I suggest that you take a day at the zoo and learn what it's all about."
"40","s.r c.","How about the area that's referred to as: The Old Zoo..  Who is responsible for that section of Griffith Park? 

If anyone has visited that section of the park you have probably noticed that it has become more of an attraction for locals and tourist.  But as much as I am proud of that area, I am also embarrassed to point anyone in that direction, because it has been neglected like a crack-house.  

The area has tons of graffiti [what's that number again, 311, do you think they will come?] including protruding fencing, moveable stones, lack of lightning and cameras at night - that makes for a perfect place for vandals and drug addicts to ensconce themselves at dusk - and, I almost forget, the smell of stench eminating from all the rotten food and occasional feces and urine.  

Maybe the Master Plan should appropriate money for this section of the park, even if they are not responsible for the upkeep as a good gesture to the community so it can be restored and properly monitored.  Otherwise, it sounds like they are just re-inventing themselves."

But I will say that children don't need zoos to develop empathy for animals; that's a rather poor excuse for keeping them around. My 3-year-old has never been to a zoo (or even a petting zoo). Instead, we've taken her to the Gentle Barn, Animal Acres and the Wildlife Learning Center in Sylmar. She has an amazing appreciation for animals - both those that she meets in person at sanctuaries and those that we read about in books - and she doesn't believe for a second that animals are meant to entertain us from behind bars or tiny enclosures. 

For all of the non-zoo folks on this thread - I would suggest giving your money to the organizations named above. Vote with your dollars."

"40","Skip W.","To those that think it is entertaining and/or educational to bring your children to a zoo, I ask you to please rethink this. It is nothing short of torture for a wild animal to be out of its natural habitat and not able to engage in its natural behavior.  Wether you realize it or not, one of the things your children are learning by going to the zoo is that it is ok to exploit and abuse a sentient being for our entertainment. There are so many more effective and compassionate ways to teach kids about wild animals. We owe it to our children to help create a more compassionate world by instilling compassion and empathy in them. The kids would learn much more about these animals and build compassion and empathy if they worked on projects exploring and explaining why these animals should be moved to sanctuaries and the zoos closed down."
"40","Cheri B.","Good question - the difference is that dogs, cats, etc. are domesticated animals and unable to survive in the wild on their own.  It is well researched and documented that elephants and other wild animals housed in zoos are not happy.  They become depressed and often ill.  Zoos are a throwback to our ignorant past when we didn't know any better.  Also, taking children to a zoo to see this archaic abuse is teaching them the wrong thing.  Wildlife parks and sanctuaries are better options for these animals that are already in zoos, and closing zoos altogether is the goal."
"40","Elena W.","I think the animals that are kept at the zoo should only be ones that for some reason are unable to make it on their own in the wild. The zoo in Prescott, AZ, is like that. I thought it was a good idea."
"40","Patty M.","My last comment on this thread... all of you talking about ""sanctuaries"", I hope you know what that often entails. Not accredited by any reliable source (literally, the same standards as usda holds most factory farms to), very little oversight of how money is spent, and animals who are frequently bred ""accidentally"" because donors will give money for babies. I personally worked for a ""sanctuary"" in the la area, and cried when I saw the tiger habitat at the San Diego wild animal park. Because I wished my tigers could have such a beautiful home, and such good care (I spoke to the keepers, and knew what questions to ask.) The LA zoo does amazing work in the conservation field, and I guarantee the health care these animals receive is better than 99% of you get. People think the animals are ""sad"" because they've read one propaganda article by peta and don't actually understand the animals at all."

"40","Patty M.","Morgan k., the website you linked to is interesting, but 95% of the sanctuaries are for horses. A very few are focused on primates, and fewer yet on big cats. One or two seemed to work with other exotics. Not exactly helpful when the discussion is on saving wildlife and exotics. Emma Elizabeth... the la zoo is run by the city and the nonprofit GLAZA. It is not a for-profit entity. The San Diego zoo is for profit, and still a pioneer in conservation efforts.... that's the entire reason the ""san diego wild animal park"" came into existence. Roadside zoos are terrible, but it seems you haven't looked into the actual work being done by good zoos, such as the la zoo."
"40","Michelle P.","You are correct Emma, zoos are For Profit, they are barbaric and cruel for various reasons I won't say here. Animals are not ours to exploit, abuse or kill!  Sanctuaries or wild spaces are the only way as they allow the animal to live protected in their natural habitat! This planet can do fine without humans but humans can not live without the plants and animals of the earth! More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. This is nearly 1,000 times the ""natural"" or ""background"" rate and, say many biologists, is greater than anything the world has experienced since the vanishing of the dinosaurs nearly 65m years ago.

"40","Alessandra Franco","Patty M, you may be knowledgeable about a lot of things but PETA is not one of them. PETA has mobile units that spay and neuter for free and a shelter at their headquarters in Norfolk, VA. They encourage people to adopt animal companions and save lives. Dogs and cats are domesticated animals who can't survive in the wild. In addition, we owe overpopulation to irresponsible humans who don't spay and neuter, abandon their pets and keep breeders in business. It's our responsibility to fix the mess we created. As for zoos, saying that it's been around for hundred of years only means it's archaic and obsolete much like circus and Sea World. I visited the LA Zoo once and most of the animals seemed miserable and were kept in enclosures way too small for them. The crocodiles in particular were kept in a tiny dirty disgusting pond. Taking animals away from their natural habitats just so your children can see them up close is arrogant and cruel. Animals are not meant to live in captivity and I can only hope to live long enough to see the day all zoos are long gone. If you propose to turn it into a conservation so they can rehabilitate animals such as condors, great. But all other wild animals there should be sent to sanctuaries. Let's name it LA Condor Conservancy and scratch Zoo from the name completely. I can support that!"

"40","Connie H.","Actually Allesandra - Patty is correct.  PETA does not want anyone to have pets. They view this as cruel and against nature.  I learned this after donating for years."
"40","Alessandra Franco","I'm sorry but I need to repeat that that's not true. I worked at PETA LA and staff is allowed to bring their dogs to work. They rescue, foster and I participated in several events including a chicken adoption day which we do annually here in LA so I have no idea what you're talking about. If you have evidence to back it up, I'd love to see it."
"40","Michelle K.","There is not enough room at the LA Zoo to keep elephants in particular. Their history with pachyderms is shameful."
"40","Connie H.","Allessandra, I have no idea what you did for PETA.  But, this is from their own website. http://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/pets/  After seeing this andother statements of 'owning pets being abismal' by the leaders of PETA years ago I stopped donating.  I am an educated person who chooses charities wisely.  This bothered me enough to say, 'no thanks,' to PETA.  Any organization that is trying to save me and my pets from ourselves is too big brother for me."
"40","Alessandra Franco","Ummmm... I feel you may have misinterpreted this. PETA is opposed to the pet overpopulation which is a direct result of human beings who are not responsible pet owners by abandoning them, not spaying and neutering and buying animals from breeders thus keeping them in business and causing millions of animals to be put to death every year in shelters around the world. If PETA could go back hundreds of year and stop the domestication of animals from happening, would they? Absolutely because they don't believe animals are ours to do whatever we want with and because we domesticated them way back when and we now have so many unwanted pets, the solution we came up with it is to kill the cats and dogs no one wants which is what kill shelters do. It really doesn't matter what position I held because we all go through weeks of training and everyone who works at PETA is well versed on their core values. We have a 24/7 emergency hotline that anyone can call to report animal abuse and we have a CID department that goes out and investigates all reports. The staff volunteers to be on call and be paged to screen the calls that come in and rank them in order of urgency. We also volunteer to rescue animals and take them to the local shelter so they can get care when needed and a lot of us end up adopting the animals we foster. I had the privilege of driving 2 dogs we rescued from Norfolk to D.C. To their new forever home. If PETA believed people shouldn't have pets, they wouldn't work so hard to find them good homes. But remember PETA is not only an animal rescue group. It's an animals rights organization and there's a big difference between animal rights and animal welfare. I'll just repost the last paragraph of the link you posted because I'm sorry to see that you seemed to have missed the point of it. I'm happy to discuss this more with you in detail because even though I no longer work there I fully support the organization, I still volunteer for them and they're a beneficiary in my will. Specifically please see the line where we're actually encouraging people to have 2 pets instead of one so they can have a companion ""Contrary to myth, PETA does not want to confiscate animals who are well cared for and “set them free.” What we want is for the population of dogs and cats to be reduced through spaying and neutering and for people to adopt animals (preferably two so that they can keep each other company when their human companions aren’t home) from pounds or animal shelters—never from pet shops or breeders—thereby reducing suffering in the world"""
"40","Patty M.","Alessandra f. Peta has killed between 73 and 96 percent of the animals in their ""shelters"" in the last five years. I know I will never convince you that they are bad, but anyone else reading this should look up the ""PETAS better off dead"" philosophy article on bestfriends.org. I don't think there's an animal lover alive who doesn't want spay/neuter to be mandatory, and for the backlog of ""unwanted""pets to be minimized (I myself own two rescues, and am adopting a third). But that is not what peta is about. The people in charge of PETA literally think that ""owning"" an animal is abuse, no matter the care. They don't tend to share this publicly, as most people who love animals also have a pet or two (and PETA wants money more than anything). They also don't necessarily share this opinion with low level staff, who probably own pets. The ideology of the leaders is grotesque, and the number of animals they kill every year is also grotesque."
"40","Patty M.","Also, allisandra f... what do you think a crocodiles natural habitat looks like? A clear swimming pool? It's dirty and cloudy. For a reason. Much easier to sneak up on prey when you're not obvious. People (like you) seem to want animals to have the same environment you would want, without thinking of what is natural and comfortable for a different species."
"40","Song T.","This time I gotta say something to not only to Patty but for like minded people... Why would zoo be a natural environment for any animals????? But a prison, confinement, ripping animals out of their true natural habitat & family instilling fear & confusion overseen by selfish, self-righteous narcissistic people who misuse the brain not for being a part of nature and watch but for controlling every little single thing and making a mess of it trying to play god. Love them where they are and where they belong. They don't have to be caged to be loved and studied. If you want to study their behavior or whatever, go to their natural habitat. Don't bring them to the city and put up a fake wall and water fall and try to make them fit in. Don't leave them in a swimming pool and make them do stupid tricks and clap for them. They don't give shit if they can jump out of the water and touch the ball. All they want is to be fed  because they are being starved for tricks. Empty the cages and tanks. We've already ruin their lives. Just leave them alone and stop trying to control them. I don't like it and no one else likes it when we are being controlled. Why would they? Ef'n Chinese feed live animals in their zoo. We humans are the most barbaric of them all. Carnivores kill to eat. We instigate, scheme, and watch like bunch sick buttheads who's got nothing better to do. Vindictive creatures that we are. Constantly bicker and fight for everything.

"40","Alessandra Franco","Patty M, you'll believe whatever you chose to believe. I can't change that. I worked closely with the founder and CEO Ingrid Newkirk as well as the VP of Development, the VP of Communications and the VP of Campaigns to name a few. I did all of their high level fundraising events including their 35th gala last year.   The thing is everyone from top to bottom does everything. We all work take turns working the hotline, rescuing and fostering including Ingrid who I witnessed stop a speaking engagement to help rescue who had gotten inside one of our trucks by mistake and when dismounted the floor of the car to get the cat, it darted out and jumped in the river. 3 PETA CID staff then jumped in the river after him, including someone who couldn't swim! The cat was rescued and once we knew it was safe, Ingrid resumed the event. Anyway, Connie sounds like an intelligent and reasonable person but I feel anything I say would just be ignored and twisted around by you so I'm done with this thread. Take care everyone #adoptdontshop #emptythecages #closeallthezoos"

One of the best things about living in the 21st century is there is abundance of food especially here in southern Cal. I've survived many years without eating animals. Matter of fact I've become healthier on plant based food. My skin likes it better. My stomach and cabeza likes it better. Zits are gone. No more horrendous painful Cramps in the morning. And best of all no more migraine. Here is a small list of protein without dead flesh.

You can find out more about who can and cannot vote, when it comes to criminal records, here: http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voting-california/who-can-vote-california/voting-rights-californians/

As for voter fraud in general, it doesn't really happen. The logical scenario you point is reasonable to think of, however in practice it's rarely happened. That aside, stricter voting laws (especially around required ID) have been shown to disproportionately affect lower-income and minority voters.

""The Sharp household had first been identified as suspicious by computer software that had been provided to the Ohio Voter Integrity Project by a national organization called True the Vote. The software, which has been distributed to similar groups around the country, is used to flag certain households, including those with six or more registered voters. This approach inevitably pinpoints many lower-income residents, students, and extended families.""

@Kevin, you asked about voter fraud. It doesn't really happen. So your concern about whether someone ""is a non-citizen or felon"" is moot. I tried to be nice and you were a jerk, so... here we are.

@Jonathan, in some states, legislation is passed *specifically* to make it more difficult for *some* minorities to get identification. Not all minorities are ""equal"" in the eyes of our system, clearly. I'm an atheist, and believe it or not, there's probably more legislated against me than you at this point.

@Alexander, good. You've wasted your vote entirely. A vote for a third-party candidate, at least, would have given them greater standing in the next election against a fully loaded Democratic Congress *and* White House. But hey, keep that tinfoil hat on tight! Alex Jones will rescue you soon! ;)

@Brad, when people say things like ""there is more and more evidence,"" without actually providing evidence to the thing, it doesn't do much aside from make people worried for no good reason.

It just comes down to the country being honest with itself, we are either going be a nation of laws and follow the constitution or not. i would respect a politician or political party that was honest and said i don't believe in the constitution, i want non citizens to vote along with our borders to be open, instead of misleading voters and being part of corruption on both sides.

Say what you may about Bernie, and he would not have been my choice, though you have to at least give him credit for his ability to say what he believes. wouldn't it be great if we could just vote for someone and not find out later they have to sets of beliefs  ( and that goes for both parties). we have got to come together as a country."
"49","Ethan B.","@Jonathan,

""having to show a proper birth certificate to get an ID is a far cry from states targeting minorities."" -- Wrong

https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/03/courts-are-finally-pointing-out-the-racism-behind-voter-id-laws/?utm_term=.8032bd598b0d

""I thought you said there was little or no voter fraud."" -- That's because, as I pointed out in the links I posted earlier, there is little or no voter fraud.

""You can't have it both ways."" -- Well, don't create a false dichotomy for me to choose from, then. ;)

""And yes, there are a few states who's charters prohibit an atheist from running for state legislature but you can't ignore what's happening to Christians and Jews around the world and how religion is being bashed in our own colleges and universities and elsewhere."" -- LOL. Yes, tell me more about how *your* beliefs should be sacred, and everyone else should be required to go along with whatever they happen to be. Sorry, the age of ""don't ask, don't tell"" when it comes to harmful beliefs passed a few decades ago.

I'm going to assume when you say ""what's happening to Christians and Jews around the world,"" you're pointing to Islam? Please, if that's wrong, correct me. As for being ""based in our colleges and universities and elsewhere,"" I'm pretty sure you can't provide any evidence to support that.

""Just a few examples: modern art of a Crucifix in urine and a professor asking his students to write Jesus on a piece of paper and step on it. Not sure of any other religion in America that this happens to."" -- So what? Art is expression. Expression is free speech. Would you complain if a professor asked students to write the name of Mohammed (PBUH), or do you only complain when you feel it's Christianity that's being ""disadvantaged?""

There's a reason this false ""War on Christianity"" exists, and it's fear."

"49","Jonathan K.","Ethan. 
I too found this article about voter fraud:  www.nationalreview.com/article/375021/dems-voter-fraud-denial-john-fund. 

Your comment, ""why should my beliefs be sacred and everyone else should be required to go along with whatever they happen to be."" I never said my beliefs were sacred and that you or anyone are required to go along with it. That's your interpretation.  Don't you think that's a bit of fear mongering as well? 

You say I can't provide evidence to support what's happening to Christians and then you site the evidence I just purported? Those are only a few examples. You also might want to check out State Bill 1146. You then raise the issue of ""freedom of expression."" So degrading Christianity is called freedom of expression but when Christians express their religious freedoms they are accused of imposing their beliefs on atheists? 

And ""would I complain if a professor asked to write the name of Mohammed or do I only complain when it's Christianity being disadvantaged""?  If a professor asked his students to write the name Mohammed on a piece of paper, throw it on the ground and step on it, you're darn right I would complain. It would be despicable no matter what religious figure it was. The point is, and you kind of made it for me, is that it would never happen to the name Mohammed. No professor in his right mind would do that!

Did you find that link on Alex Jones' website? I'm just kidding. National Review is a pretty right-leaning media outlet. I mean, I get that no one trusts *any* media outlet at this point, so I don't know  Here's my litmus test: does the article refer to ""the other"" as ""conservative"" or ""liberal?"" If so, it's probably too far afield to be trusted. Don't trust the National Review.

State Bill 1146... great example of legislated discrimination based on the beliefs of individuals, rather than any objective data. Why do religious institutions persist in sticking their thumb in every progressive movement? Do you know it would have been illegal for me to marry my wife (miscegenation) until almost 1960 because we are of different races? That was a construct maintained by the religious majority. So was slavery. In fact, you can go allllll the way back to 1790 and find discriminatory law on the side of religion: if you weren't a professing Christian, you weren't allowed to vote. That's dumb. No more legislated discrimination. If California gets it's own RFRA, I expect the ""gay mafia"" to head to the streets with their ""fabulous agenda."" :P

I think what you are perceiving as a ""Christian persecution"" is in fact a ""leveling of the playing field,"" much in the same way race is being confronted. The United States was founded as a secular State, and it remains so today. That the majority *have been* Christian has made this ""Christo-normative culture"" you believe to be under attack.

Boy howdy, we're going to see some minds BLOWN when gay couples start having children that are 100% genetically theirs (without a surrogate) in about 20 years.

You know... if you want to have an honest conversation about religion, you're going to have to be a lot more honest about what you *really believe* about other people and their beliefs."

Let me guess... you're a birther, right?"
"49","Jonathan K.","Ethan. 

Yes, the National Review I'm sure leans to the right. But are you denying that the sites you refer to don't lean to the left just a bit? Come on, be honest. And whether it is left or right, it still points out certain facts. If you're saying that those ""facts"" are not true, that I can understand.

It also seems to me that the ""progressive"" movement is sticking it's thumb into the religious sector as well by determining how religious institutions must carry out their business. Your idea of a ""progressive movement"" seems to be determining how religious institutions and businesses should act according to progressive values. There is a lot of mean spirited hateful rhetoric on both sides. It's not just one-sided. And conversely, there are many wonderful Christians and many wonderful atheists. 

Of course, you are absolutely right that racism was a terrible blight and Christians had a part in it no doubt as well as non-religious people. Racism comes in all forms.  Actually, the Democratic Party was extremely racist, voting in Jim Crow laws, giving rise to the KKK etc...The founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger was a major racist. Did many claim to be Christians? Of course. Men have been perverting religion for many years. To me, it isn't a condemnation of religion so much as the people who pervert it.  By the way, more killing occurred during the twentieth century alone by secular regimes than by religious men throughout history. 

And as far as the US being founded as a secular state, you could't be more wrong. It was founded as a secular government and a nation rooted in Judeo-Christian values. i.e.: ""Endowed by our Creator."" This means that our inalienable rights cannot be given or taken away by any man, state or king. The belief is that God gave us these rights which transcends man. 

Just curious:  would you be just as critical about any other religion these days or just Christianity?

What I ""really believe about other people and their beliefs""? Not sure what you mean by ""other people."" I'm being about as honest here as I can be. 

Not sure how we got on the subject, but two men or two women, no matter how hard they try, cannot have a biological baby without a surrogate. It's been a while since I took biology but I'm pretty sure I'm right about this one. 

                         Take care and thanks for the challenge. I appreciate your passion."
"49","Ethan B.","@Jonathan,

There are no sites left that do not lean. That is the reality of our partisan nature. The same mechanisms that have driven the people apart, have driven the content they desire apart as well. One person does not trust the government or their data. The other does not trust the media. The other does not trust their neighbor. 

That aside, there's the notion of ""fact"" in this context, which is likewise ""untrusted"" by wide swathes of the public thanks to the orange mouthpiece. So, where does that leave us? Consider a break from the paradigm: quit worrying about which way things lean. Examine evidence, consider sources, and exercise compassion.

*pours tall glass of wine*

Now then, on to the rest.

When you say things like ""progressive movement,"" it gives the image that there's some group actually plotting these things. That's silly. Honestly, I don't really give a shit what religious institutions do inside their walls. Most secularists don't, except that *some* of those things are incredibly harmful to people. In the context of gender rights, the ""progressive movement"" has been *aching* to shut down things like gay conversion therapy and female circumcision.

As a matter of philosophy, should any beliefs be protected from scrutiny? I suggest the answer is a binary: it's either ""yes"" or ""no."" If you believe all beliefs (or lack thereof) should be protected (yes), then a complete separation of Church and State is prescribed: this means no more tax-free status, sorry Church. If your answer is ""no,"" then you think ideology should overrule sound judgment. And I think we both know how that has worked out, historically, regardless of the deity being considered.

No doubt you're right: there's a lot of mean-spirited rhetoric on both sides. One thing there is not, however, is rote harm. *That* is the realm of the religious institution. You are welcome to offer evidence to the contrary, of course.

I don't suppose you think you're the first person to use the ""well think of the horrors you secularists performed!"" apology, right? ;)

Hitler was Christian (Catholic, I think). So was Mussolini. Hitler and the German Catholic Churches worked together toward their shared ""final solution,"" so keep that in mind next time. Pol Pot was (probably) a Buddhist, so was Chairman Mao. Not a secularist amongst them. Mussolini was also Catholic. Which ""killing by secular regimes"" were you referring to, again?

In fact, historically you'll find the Church behind or in league with... pretty much every atrocity.

As for the secular founding of the United States, I will refer you to the writings of well-known and well-established deist, Thomas Jefferson, ""Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear. . . . Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no God, you will find inducements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you."" Our founding fathers may have *believed* in a higher power, but they did not found a religious state in honor of one.

When it comes to criticality, I think my answer regarding the philosophy discussed earlier in this reply is clearly ""Yes."" No belief is above scrutiny, nor should it be taken out of the context of it's adjacent beliefs. As I've said before, the time for harmful beliefs to exist in a vacuum of ""political correctness"" is far beyond over. I don't care what deity you worship, if it's telling you to harm someone else via your actions, you can bet I'll be critical of that. Isn't that what Jesus would do?

Now, to close out, here's some mind-blowing science for you. Between this: http://time.com/3748019/same-sex-couples-biological-children/ and this: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3173446/World-s-test-tube-baby-reveals-mother-received-blood-splattered-HATE-MAIL-born-including-letter-containing-plastic-foetus.html, you can bet it's coming. I give it 25 years, maximum, before two (or more) consenting adults can create a child that is 100% genetically theirs, with no other organic help (a la a surrogate.)

I hope you enjoyed the read! Vote for anyone but Trump! :-D"
"49","Hannah B.","@Kevin - I don't know if it's already been answered as I didn't read all the comments. But I think the answer to your original question would be that when people initially register to vote, their information is verified to make sure that they meet the eligibility requirements (citizen, non-felon, 18+, etc). When you actually go to the polling place, their job is simply to make sure you are in the book and haven't already voted.

Also - just FYI for everyone, in case you should be in the book and aren't, you can try contacting the LA County Registrar-Recorders office at (800) 815-2666, as they should be able to confirm your information to the poll worker so you can get a ballot, and worst case scenario you can receive a provisional ballot."
"49","Bea B.","How did this propaganda get on Next Door?"
"49","Jonathan K.","Ethan, 

  Long time, no talk to. Yes, you are absolutely right. We have become divided as a nation. It's like an ideological civil war going on out there. Honestly, what really gives me hope is when people can have a civil and respectful disagreement about issues. It's important to at least hear the other side of an issue whether you agree or not. I appreciate your text quite a bit. 

  Religion to me is essential in that it establishes that there is a higher authority than man, giving meaning to life. To think that man is the final word is pretty depressing. Has Christianity throughout history abided by these tenets? No way. You're absolutely right.  Now we have a radical portion (not all of course but that goes without saying)  of jihadists doing terrible things around the world. The treatment of Christians, Jews, not to mention gays and women in certain parts of the world is horrendous. 

  Once again, this is more of a criticism of man rather than ""religion."" in my opinion. And yes, there obviously is quite a divide between the gay community and the Church. I agree that ""conversion therapy"" as you state, is ridiculous. If someone is hard wired to be gay or straight, I believe that's the way they are. Frankly, I couldn't care less about someone's sexual orientation as long as they are a decent person. Your article, however, states that if someone believes that it takes a man and a woman to have a biological baby, that thinking makes them ""anti-gay."" I believe that's also a bit over the top. I'm not judging either way, but isn't science itself acting as the surrogate? 

 You also say a few times that if your belief is ""telling you to harm"" someone...etc. Please point out how people are being ""harmed."" And I mean this sincerely. Who is being harmed or forced to do something? 

 Also, be careful about cherry picking certain quotes. Jefferson also said, ""the fragmentary teachings of Jesus constituted the outlines of a system of the most sublime morality which has ever fallen from the lips of man."" And even if he was a full blown atheist, so what. My comments still hold true. Secular government. Judeo-Chrisitian nation but free to practice any religion or not practice at all. It's what the Founding Fathers intended. 

  And not that you don't know this but the phrase ""Wall of Separation of Church and State"" is not in  the constitution. It was in a letter that Jefferson wrote to  the Danbury Baptist Society. It was intended to keep the state out of people's business so that they could practice their religion freely. 

 And finally.... Hitler was no more a Christian than I'm a professional football player. He was raised Catholic but denounced it as an adult. His henchmen persecuted many churches and he worked to reduce the influence of Christianity in society. He did what he did in the name of race superiority and power but not ""religion"". 

 I know we may not agree on everything but I do appreciate your challenges. I love the first amendment and the ability to exercise it with people of intelligence and character.  Best of luck."

@Jonathan K., 

Yep, I agree: religion (as an institution) continues to disadvantage and discriminate on a global scale. This includes Christians, Jews, and Muslims, amongst (pretty much) every other religion as well. Even Jainism, one of the most peaceful religions in the world, is misogynistic in it's tenants (women have a harder time advancing). Certainly rote misogyny isn't as terrible as throwing someone off a building for their sexual orientation. That being said, I'm not a relativist. Terrible is terrible. Considering what extremists do in other countries is a red herring if you're comparing it to what extremists do here, by and large.

The article (from Time magazine, just so we're being objective), states this:

""Throughout history, a child has come from a man and a woman. It’s been one of the tenets of anti-gay activists for decades: “Two men can’t have a biological child, and two women can’t have one either.""

What Time has stated is ""anti-gay activists don't believe two men or two women can have a biological baby."" What you have said Time has stated is ""believing it takes a man and a woman to make a baby makes one anti-gay,"" which is, again, a clear misrepresentation of what Time magazine stated in the link provided.

As for science acting as ""surrogate,"" that presumes a theistic worldview. Science has *always* been the factor leading to pregnancy, even when we haven't understood it as such. Hence our ability to stop it using a variety of prophylatic and pharmaceutical means. Those are well-established and well-practiced, despite Catholicism (as an institution) wishing otherwise.

Ah, so ""harm"" as a general concept: let's say you are a child born to a strictly Hassidic family (still widely practiced throughout Europe and many major metropolitan areas within the United States), and you are gay. Your family's beliefs will harm you, very probably, because they will not accept you for who you are, due to their personal beliefs, rather than your individual person. The options are 1) accept the harm, or 2) be forced to change, a la ""gay conversion therapy."" Do you see a third way?

You can talk all you want about how the US was founded as a ""Judeo-Christian Nation,"" but that won't make it true. There's a difference between being a Christonormative nation (as we are and have been since our founding), and being a Christian nation. You're going to want to go to Rome for that.

As for Hilter: whether or not he was a ""Devout Christian"" is irrelevant. The German Churches were complicit with the Third Reich in attempting to destroy the Jews. Soooo... even if Hitler wasn't Christian, you can sure bet the German Churches were. And they were more than happy to sit back while Hitler ran roughshod over Europe, so long as the Jews went away. ;)

Happy Friday! Thanks for being respectful despite our obvious theological differences. :)"

"54","Jason H.","Welcome to LA sanitation to Nextdoor-Lake Balboa!      
We need more public trash cans!   As an avid dog walker, I am very familiar with all neighborhood streets north of Victory to Roscoe and West of Balboa to White oak.   I could easily recommend several spots to consider adding public trash cans to significantly reduce litter.  The most glaring and obvious spot is the SouthEast corner of Vanowen-Louise, by 7-11.  There are always several pizza slice containers on the ground on both sides of van Owen.   

Thanks for your willingness to seek feedback and to offer assistance!"
"54","Dalton S.","How do we Cancel Trash Service?  Have No Yard to speak of at my Mother's Home and we bring her household trash home here to dispose of so we do not have to deal with her barrels.  It would also help her to eliminate that part of her Bill on a tight budget."

"54","Mike Z.","Is there anything we can do with the cars on Milwood that literally take up all the parking and leave no room for you to set your cans for trash days. Your left with sometimes leaving them in your drive way because there is no room. Then on occasion the driver will leave the respective bin because it either is not spaced 3 feet apart or it's too close to the vehicles."

The reason that trash pick-up is so expensive; Previous Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa doubled and tripled the fee shortly after being elected, under the guise of funding the hiring of 10,000 new police officers. Can’t you see them all..?? (Now he wants to run for Governor in 2018).

Re; Street sweeping: The last time I inquired with the city as to why street sweeping here in Tujunga was stopped! The answer was that our city council woman, Wendy Greuel at the time cancelled it….Guess she wanted to divert the money to some of her pet projects.

I’ve said it before and I will say it again…You get what (Who) you vote for..!!"

The problem here is the gardeners try to pick it up but there's always cars parked in front of our houses so that we cannot clean there .  The are cars that come from the apartments around us.   If we can get some street cleaning on the street then when it rains all that polluted water and leaves would not go down into the storm drains .   We need no parking for street cleaning  on designated days .  It would help our storm drains"

Sanitation in your next campaign to inform the masses, can you please tell them about 311? People can call it as well as using the app. I can't believe how effective it's been, but I think it could be even more effective with more education about the app. I've shared it with many concerned friends, but I really think many people haven't heard of it."
"54","Daniel B.","Are you folks responsible for street cleaning? In my view (and many others) it doesn't seem to do much other than move the fallen leaves around. Maybe I'm a bit cynical, but seems like just an excuse to collect money from parking tickets (the cost of which by the way seems way to high - i.e. the punishment doesn't fit the ""crime""). What is the cost of the program vs. the funds collected from parking tickets? In my humble opinion it is high time this program gets the boot!"

I was told deal with it as it's prorated and nothing can be done. I wonder why nothing can be done? I recycle, I don't create much waste as I use storage containers for food that I wash and reuse and I feel there should be a program or rebate for those like me who limit their trash to once a month. Or only pick mine up the 1st Monday of the month and charge me accordingly."
"54","Matt M.","And I also use 311 for many things such as large item removal, graffiti, and illegal leaf blowing which happens at dollar tree monthly and usually at 5:30am and hopefully that will stop soon. The more our neighborhood stays on top of things the happier we will all be;)"

There was a queen-sized mattress and box spring set out by some irresponsible mole right on the corner of La Mirada and Cahuenga Blvd. Cars had to drive around it for two weeks. The garbage trucks must have had to, also, as well as the street sweeper. I finally called 311 for pickup and it was gone by the next Friday. However, at the same time there was a mattress propped up to a light pole right across from the mattress and box spring and that wasn't disturbed! Can't we all be in this together? How can the garbage guys and the street cleaners just go on by these things without calling it in?"

There are people that go up and down the street from Sunday night to about 9 am Monday morning. They make a mess, get the dogs barking and are stealing from the city. One lady has a very nice SUV, so it's not that she needs the money, but is making a nice living stealing the recyclables. My husband yells at them and chases them off the street when he sees them."

Don't get me on that ""long life' number, cause it's not true, they seem to blow-out a lot faster than the old-time ones, and they made a scary exploding sound when they do.

It is uneven and still not very safe for children, elderly, disabled or anyone really. It will probably take another 2 years for them to do stump removal."
"57","Judy Reidel","Please water you trees.  Run sprinklers or hose at low rate for 2-4 hours away from trunk so that it gets deep watering at the roots.  Do this every week.  Yes it's a long time but the roots are way down and dry. When trees recovers can do every 2 weeks.  This is expensive loss especially if someone or their car gets hit.  The drought and unwatered trees invite beetles to finish them off. Save our street trees please give them a long slow drink.  Do same for trees on your property."

"57","Judy Reidel","Everyone  in Country club park was asked to deep water your street trees.  If you don't want the cost of water and prefer dead trees then pay for permit and removal which can cost thousands instead of water bill.  Take a trip to Glendale to see where water is stored n get free recycled water. Even a few gallons will help. Our school toured the amazing facility when it was empty for cleaning and maintenance. It's in interesting canyon in Glendale.  That's enuf with complaining.  Deep water your trees and parkway grass so that the others can be saved.  Big trees roots are spread out to ends of branches.  Needs water to go down deep."

I highly encourage everyone to take advantage of this program and help sustain our environment for ourselves, and our children.

The requirement of a government issued ID is not racist. It serves not only to prove that you are a resident of the county, but it is also a mandatory ID anytime you enter a government facility. This is absolutely normal."

Yes, it could be cheaper, but is it right, during a possible 50-year drought?  If you're irrigating your yard with an automatic sprinkler system, chances are you're pouring drinking water into the storm drains around your property.

I have a separate meter just for my irrigation water... which I do not pay for any sanitation/sewage charges... it is even cheaper than my household water... so this makes no sense to me.

And what about capturing the runoff before it makes it into the ocean and polluting our beaches when (if) it rains; or better yet, when a water main breaks?

We use many of these on our plant to collect samples for testing.  I also used these when our family had a salt water tank to purchase saline water. 5 gallons of water at it's densest is roughly 42 pounds, so please consider bringing your own help, if you have back problems. These containers are also be available for purchase at most aquarium stores."
"58","LJ K.","This might have seemed like a good idea, but I don't think anyone did the math. We pay $4.61 per HCF (748 gallons), so divide it, multiply by 300, and the cost would be $1.85 for 300 gallons.
The weight is 300 x8.34 lbs, so 2502 pounds.
You would easily spend more money on gasoline & wear & tear on your car versus turning on your sprinklers.
There are other ways to save water. What about a shower that recirculated & filters the water, even possibly filters that water into reclaimed water for out yards?

"58","John L.","Steve - of course using re-cycled water is a good idea - but it only really makes sense for end users if that recycled water comes down a pipe to their taps. If you're concerned about your carbon footprint as well..even Silver Lake may not be worth the drive.

Lets see.. LA DWP sells you fresh water for about $6 per Hundred Cubic Feet - close enough to 750 gallons so about 0.8 cents a gallon - so your free 300 gallons is a savings of $2.40ish. 
Round trip in my Prius which get about 35mpg for 10 miles from Silver Lake to the DWP in Glendale  - call it 1/3rd of a gallon times what do you pay $2.75? = about 90 cents. Ignoring CO2 and wear and tear - yes 300 gallons makes sense. But my Prius would be lucky to carry 50 gallons, which LA DWP sells to me for 40 cents.

So even for you in Silver Lake, it doesn't make economic sense, and as far as impact on the environment goes - who would even know where to start measuring??

I've had rain barrels for at least 15 years - and economically it made sense  only because we got the 250 gallons worth of barrels for free. What actually (IMHO) made a lot more sense from an environmental standpoint was replacing the front lawn with Mediterranean and succulent plants, and restricting watering of the back lawn to a minimal amount. Our water consumption has been in the 2 to3 HCF (Hundred Cubic Foot) range for years.

I'm all for doing things that make sense...but let's not get carried away with virtue signalling."
"58","Carroll N.","Michael S. from University Hills.... Hi...I live on Bundy Dr. between Montana and Dorothy in a 12 unit townhouse complex.  We have a heavily landscaped property and put a 2nd meter on our irrigation line about 3 1/2 years ago.  Our plumber installed the meter.  If you have a plumber you love, ask him if it's something he does.  There's a bit of leg work, getting the permit, going to the DWP to get the meter, etc. and arranging for the inspection.  It's possible to do that part yourself, if you want to, which would bring down your hourly costs from your plumber.  We had our plumber do everything.  

Our plumbing company is:  Richard's R&R Plumbing - 626-844-6666.  If you call Richard, you can tell him Carroll Newman from So. Bundy Townhomes HOA referred you.  Putting the irrigation meter in, cut our sanitation charges down to less than half of what we previously paid, and seems to be going down more and more.  We've added hose bibs at several valves on the property, so that our hose water goes through the meter as well.

Good luck,

Our councilman, Koretz, did introduce a motion to subsidize grey water systems, just like the turf removal program.
It was blocked by Councilmember Fuentes, now that he is gone, it is LADWP and Metropolitan Water District blocking it.
They are in the business of selling water and I have heard some ridiculous excuses why we shouldn't have recycled water to irrigate our plants.
We will get the grey water systems only if we create enough pressure and ensure DWP does what is best for the city.
They now talk about a California ""WaterFix"" that will do anything but fix our infrastructure or bring more water to LA. Instead they are planning to build massive tunnels from the Bay Delta to Kern County to grow more almonds and other water intensive export crops in the desert.
We will get that bill in four ways: increased water bill, property tax, state tax and federal tax. In exchange we get no new water, no fix to our existing infrastructure, no grey water system. Nothing.

Besides, research if your LOCAL LA Sanitation or LADWP location offers this opportunity...
SAVE money and reduce CO2 for your kids by not driving to the supermarket a block away (get some exercise and walk), and by ridesharing / taking public transportation (reduce the number of cars on the road), make your own gray water: collect unused shower water, dishwashing water, etc, filter it, disinfect it, and conserve it.

LORI POTTINGER OCTOBER 17, 2016
California is poised to become an early adopter of the direct reuse of purified wastewater as a source of drinking water. The State Water Board recently released a report for public comment that indicates it is feasible to regulate direct potable reuse to produce safe and reliable drinking water (comments are due by noon on October 25, 2016). We talked to David Sedlak—one of the 12 experts who worked on the report and a member of the PPIC Water Policy Center research network—about this potential new water source."

Consider disconnecting fire hydrants from the City's drinking water supply system and installing dedicated water lines to City parks, parkways and fire hydrants that are fed with recycled water. This would also enable the use of sea water to fight fires when the 100 year old drinking water supply pipes rupture in the next major earthquake."

Again I've called and still nothing.  where are our  hard earned property taxes going to?  Please explain."
"63","Andrea W.","This is a joke right?  When our streets are in extraordinarily bad condition.  Will Garcetti hold this up as an achievement?  I've got news:  that election is already lost."
"63","Juri K.","How do we contest their results and change them from clean to dirty? How many people who live or walk on a given street are required to make the change??"
"63","Tom T.","Fix the streets!  Cleanliness is of minor importance when the streets themselves are falling apart!!"
"63","Larry B.","We have had a large pile of leaves on our Street since the last wind storm! Then I saw the street sweeper actually drive around the pile to avoid it? Isn't that their job? WTF!"
"63","Joanne F.","Went to the map; also typed in my address.  Response was had no street by this name.  I've only lived here over 50 years.  Is this supposed to be a helpful program, or just a politician's way of making us all feel a great cleanup is taking place; which, by the way, we need.  Also, the streets in the Woodland Hills area are deplorable.  Our cars are being ruined by potholes, etc.  
Appreciate an answer from someone."
"63","Kym F.","What now?  Is Garcetti and the City Council going to use this data for anything or are they just wasting tax payers' money again?  The main streets should be swept more than once per week and there should be more trash bins in busy locations and they need to be picked up more than once per week.  The gutters on Pico between Fairfax and La Brea are always full of trash and litter.  It is a disgusting and offensive sight!!!"
"63","LA Sanitation","Wow! Thank you for all of the comments on our very first Next Door post!  LA Sanitation handles the collection of trash, recycling, green waste, bulky items, etc. in addition to the maintenance of our sewer system and the protection of the city's watersheds.  You can learn more about us at www.lacitysan.org.

We love hearing from you!  Thank you for your interest!"
"63","Beverly M.","This is definitely a joke.  I wish I had a picture to post what Roscoe Blvd between Winnetka and Oso looks like.  Someone was wearing rose colored glasses when they scored it.  I couldn't agree more that another study is just a waste of our resources."
"63","Anna H.","What a waste of City Resources. The whole program doesn't work.  Should be a stain on the Mayor.   Nothing good is happening with this, it is just a waste of money!  More money thrown away!"
"63","Rebecca Berman","Perhaps LA sanitation should be citing property owners who don't seem to care whether or not their tenants pile garbage outside their buildings and leave it there for MONTHS, take a look at my tumblr called Garbage Piles of Ktown https://www.tumblr.com/blog/garbagepilesofktown"
"63","Rebecca Berman","Also when I contacted the Mayor and the city council about this issue I was told to give exact locations of all the garbage piles, this is not my responsibility, I would like our city representatives to care more about how our streets look, people in Los Angeles pay some of the highest rents in the country and yet we still have to live amongst piles of garbage, it's not right.  Make property owners take responsibility for the cleanliness of the communities that line their pockets! Most of them don't even live in these neighborhoods, but I bet if they were fined they would make their property managers do something!!"
"63","Mike M.","Why are all these ""programs"" always skewed to make the politicians look good, rather than truly reflect reality.  All it accomplishes is spending taxpayers money to give the entrenched politicians something to point to, that makes it appear that they're doing  a good job. 
For example, the southern and middle sections on Western Ave (between Franklin and Hollywood Blvd) is one of the trashiest areas in Los Angeles, short of skid row and it shows ""green"" totally clean. That area has homeless shopping carts everywhere and homeless sleeping in front of the church and near the halfway house where ex-cons roam the streets at all hours. 
Whoever drew up that map, probably never checked any of the streets and just had fun with Photoshop and the GIS mapping software, whatever. I'd fire him/her. See circled area in red on map."
"63","Deena Bowman","South Mariposa St. between 3rd and 2nd Streets always has furniture and what not dumped daily. Not to mention, the sidewalks need to be sandblasted- they are SO filthy outside that Chinese birthing center on the corner of Mariposa and 3rd."

"63","Edward W.","all of mayor Garcetti clean clean street plans are just a joke, what they really want is for all of us to get out with a broom and clean the streets yet raise taxes for piss-poor service or no service at all i was told that DOT purchased 50 million dollars worth of new equiptment, where is it? sitting in warehouses and our councilmen are allowing this to happen  they all should be ashamed of themselves.TALKING LOUD AND SAYING NOTHING!!!!!!"
"63","Mike M.","The green is #1 (clean), the #2 is yellow and #3 is red ""dirty""."
"63","Mike M.","They say they won't put a fence around the Vermont Triangle, because they don't want to pay someone to lock the gate!  Really?    I'll lock the darn gate for free and I'm sure I can get volunteers to help me out.  The politicians keep raising money, which is all they care about, while NOT listening to the public or doing anything."

"63","Picasso Wife","What does .11 mean?"
"63","Jane F.","What a waste of money. As is street cleaning, except for the parking tickets it generates. Watched the street cleaner the other day. Dirt and debris was just moved around. Not taken away."
"63","Nrique R.","My street is not a 1 the front of my house is clean but everyone else has tv's, mattresses, couches, and a bunch of other crap. I call B.S to this I personally invite The Mayor and any other official to come and take a look. I put many requests in for abandoned cars, large item pickups, and illegal dumping. This is a major fail!"

"63","Toni R.","I have lived in Winnetka on Cantara street for over 20 years and can count on one hand the times I've seen a street cleaning truck come down this street. This morning I awoke to the street being cleaned and was very surprised. I checked the chart provided and our street is rated 3. We have no signs that say no parking during specific days and times and consequently the truck was only able to clean the center of the street because of all the parked cars."

"63","Kameel T.","I know you're not going to want to hear this.  WEEKLY street sweeping is a WASTE!!!  I would rather have my street cleaned once a month and help utilize the resources to clean the rest of the city that never gets street cleaning."
"63","Lynn A.","Give us back rebates on our sanitation fees instead of this bogus attempt. I looked at the map and it LIED in my area. Our alley has NEVER been cleaned, yet it is rated as Yellow.  It is filthy.  This is a joke at taxpayers' expense!  How about putting the money towards fixing our streets?? I know there are numbers to call -- but to no avail."
"63","Linus O.","love this!!"
"63","Clare K.","I live on 76th place.  I have called 3 times to clean the mud and grass in the gutter of 76th pl and airport.  They tell me there is no resource to do this. In the mean time when people water, or wash cars or it rains the mud and grass trap water so that mosquitos can breed disease. If I was able I would take my rash can down the street and clean it up myself."
"63","R Mirna P.","A few month ago I call the city to see if they can send the sweeper to sweep my street and they told me that, my street wasn't in the list, that I need to place a request and it will take a year for the service.

We need a better explanation or a better mayor?"

Inwood Drive between Dixie Canyon Avenue and Cheltenham has at least eight properties with brush, trees or dirt blocking the road, while Cheltenham, approaching Ventura Canyon, has dirt from three up-hill(Dixie Canyon address) properties as much as six feet into the street on the left and a significant accumulation of leaves and refuse on the right.

"63","Pauline S.","Great you have clean up!  However, it's also important to change the habits of the litterers.  A no litter statewide campaign in necessary and they work.  They did in the sixties and seventies.  But new generations and newcomers have not heard these campaigns.  The schools too need to teach this as a priority.  A major state campaign is needed as soon as possible.  The litter in CA is out of control!!!"

"63","Scott B.","Hi:
Thank you for the info!  I live on Riverside Drive near Fletcher and have worked with the city over and over to sweep the streets and pick up bulky items!  After communicating with the council office, I found out that there is NO SCHEDULED STREET SWEEPING, EVER,  ON MANY OF THE MAJOR ROADS/STREETS, INCLUDING RIVERSIDE DRIVE!!!  How crazy is that???  So the street in front of my residence, never gets swept!  (Can I deduct from my taxes???)  No wonder I have to sweep it every morning before I head off to work!!!  PLEASE NOTE, IF YOUR STREET IS FILTHY, CALL STREET SERVICES TO SCHEDULE SWEEPING.  (ITRY AND CALL EVERY WEEK JUST TO MAKE A DENT.  But remember, if there is no scheduled street sweeping, the parked vehicles will always be there, and the sweeper cannot hit the curbs.  Until your street has signs identifying sweeping days, you are not getting swept!"

"63","Barbara J.","My street is listed as somewhat clean and I would agree. A request was filed with the street division of the DWP about residents who haven't taken in their trash cans for months.  I just received an email from street division stating that the request has been closed. But nothing was resolved. The trash cans continue to remain at the curb every day, even after collection day. As indicated, this has been going on for months. Why do a few people have to make a disgrace of a lovely street. Get those trash cans in after trash pick up day. Also, people should call bulk pick up about couches, toilets, etc that are put at curbside and never picked up. I care about my property so keep the street clean. Is that too much to ask?"

"63","Deb B.","In the 45 years I have lived in my house on Brennan Ave in West Hills I have seen a street sweeper 4 times .  Amazing that I can still count the times on one hand.  While other parts of the city are taken care of weekly.  Don't need the street taken care of weekly but being ignored that much isn't fair.  I've brought this up with councilman Mitch Englander but nothing was done and in fact I received no response from him or the city."

They need your help to call in such things as couches on the street. Trash piles up within days, so this means we are their eyes.  Maybe apartment buildings can post a sign that says ""bulky item pickups are free"".  They even have a ""move in/move out service"" where items are picked up.  All is available, so please encourage others to call 311 during the day or 1-800-773-2489 which is avail 24/7.  I have called in two on Monday, let us all report one (or more) illegal dumping or abandoned furniture today!"

"63","Nancy O.","Well, I can say from first hand knowledge, this map does not accurately assess my area.  I live in the area known as Manchester Square, where the homeless have taken over, and it's far worse than the map shows.  Other streets -- 99th and Hindry Place -- and the alleyways are littered with trash, discarded furniture, and so much more.  It is absolutely disgraceful that my neighbors and I have to put up with this situation.  I live on Glasgow Place, and we are surrounded by the homeless and/or their trash.  We can no longer walk our neighborhood without running into a homeless encampment."

"63","Marlea E.","Mr. Garcetti and all of city, state and federal government, the homeless problem has been thrown onto the citizen's and the underpaid police's shoulders, and this is wrong.  Because this population is growing so fast everywhere, you have to look at solutions...it means something is very wrong in the society. Walk across the new Pershing Square and anywhere, to be blinded by the beauty of the new and the sickness of the homeless living all around this opulence. Elected officials must start to address this!"
"63","Michael P.","This is a joke. I had to laugh in the recent Studio City Council meeting. Word of advice - get out of your car and WALK these streets to see how much trash there is. Don't jut drive by. One place I can assure isn't ""green"" is Vineland from Ventura to Riverside. (Arch Dr isn't looking so ""green"" either.)"
"63","Kara M.","Not accurate for me, either. My alley should be a 3 with the constant dumping and the street a two.I think my alley is where all old mattresses and giant TVs go to die. 
I have never lived in a place where people litter so freely before. Every couple of days I have to clean up the curb and parkways. People just throw their trash on the ground as they walk by, or clean out their cars by throwing trash in the gutter."
"63","Robert T.","If your street has trash or bulky Items on it, use the Application and schedule a pickup, It's free and takes very little time, if you do that consistently when people trash your neighborhood you will be well on your way to becoming a green street.  Just get involved and make a difference."
"63","Stacie F.","Hilarious... Venice is a filthy pit, the person who posted that pic above is spot on. Who cares if the streets are clean anyway when half of them are undriveable? Street sweeping is a joke, just kicks up the trash into my yard. Centinela and Culver Blvd. near my house is disgusting, the few trash cans are always overflowing and the homeless leave their garbage in the gutter. City government should be ashamed."
"63","Vikki A.","A month ago I saw a Clean Streets truck refilling his water tank on the back of his truck with water from our fire hydrant. Didn't even think this was allowed, is there a reasoning for this? Corner of El Centro Ave & Lexington Ave."

"63","Suzy B.","I zoomed in expecting Tujunga Canyon Blvd to be a red zone, but it was outdone by Apperson, surprisingly. Southeast Hillhaven, Plainview and the alleys nearby got bad scores *not* surprisingly. I guess the day they cruised TCB there weren't multiple heaps of mattresses, chairs, clothes, general junk, trash and weedy areas. I can now drive down TCB with pride! lol"
"63","Daryt F.","I love that 311 app.  I've had some issues recently with it not accepting my submission, some sort of internal glitch, I suppose.  But every time I submit an issue, there is a prompt response.  With the trash submissions, I've noticed that takes awhile, but it seems to be that they schedule these for when trash pickup normally happens in the area.  So I would expect at least a three day delay on a request like this, and possibly as long as ten days depending on when you submit the request in relation to the trash day for the area."
"63","Suzanne N.","The southeast corner of La Tijera Blvd and Thornburn St is NEVER CLEAN. There is always water and accumulated trash that is washed down the street and doesn't drain. Look on Google. You can see it. We keep complaining to the city and nothing happens. No money. No priority."
"63","Michael C.","The reason the city is so full of trash is because the sanitation department refuses to pick up when you call or they want to charge you to dump your trash I think it would be a lot easier and cheaper just to offer free trash drop-off then have to go pick it up form alleys because people won't pay the fee... [which I kind of don't blame them ... personally I'm tired of being taxed on  merchandise I purchase   and then being taxed again when I want to dispose of it.. just like we're being charged for water  out of our faucet and then being charged for the water leaving our house ..... frivolous taxation crippling the citizens ]  ..as it is cheaper for them to pick it up from you or allow you to drop it off then to have to send trucks out with shovels and men to pick up this debris"
"63","Rebecca P.","I live in the Trousdale track of Mar Vista (south of National Blvd, North of Palms. I live across the street from Palms elementary school. Our street, 3288 Granville Avenue is seldom cleaned - once a year or less. That one time os usually during school hours and the teachers and parents park on our street so, even then, our street doesn't get clean. The only thing that saves us is that we, the home owners, clean it.  There is always some stuff discarded in the alleys. Does anyone clean alleys?"
"63","Carlos T.","I can remember in the sixties when street sweepers were a normal part of life in Pedro. They did street cleaning regularly twice a week on nearly every street in Pedro, Pacific and Gaffey were cleaned in the early morning ours one or two times a week and they dumped all the public trash cans on the sidewalks. Todays trash collectors wont even pick up ;the trash they spill on collection days, we are paying a lot for very little when it comes to the city. I suggest to pass up any and all Props because not one will do what they tell us they'll do."
"63","Jessica Lim","Glad to see this data available! But I live in MacArthur Park and looking at my neighborhood I see that it has an average score of 0.17 but is in a green grid, which supposedly indicates a clean area. This map doesn't seem to be an accurate representation of the data."

"63","Randy F.","This is not going to be a popular post, but I just have to say that we citizens can also take personal responsibility to clean up the streets.  When ever I jog with my dogs, I take gloves and a garbage bag and though I look weird, I am stopping to pick up random trash in my neighborhood!  I also call 311 when ever I see a bulky trash pick up item, even if it is not my item!  And the city has been great about responding...and I feel so good to be part of the solution....my neighbors have been friendlier to me I think and I get more exercise with all the stooping and kneeling.  The trash seems to be a lot of maybe middle school and high schoolers who get fast food and then are careless with their trash, by the way (just guessing, but it looks likely)....What do you all say?"
"63","Kathryn K.","Randy F., Me too!  My daily walk of 3 miles x 7 days = 21 miles per week, a different street everyday yields what I figure is 1/2 ton per year.

"63","Sharon W.","According to the index of cleanliness of city streets, my community Western Avenue Florence to 108th Street is ""3"" one of the dirtiest. The Mayor promised to put resources on the dirtiest streets and where the highest amount of trash is generated. The Community of So L.A. has been reported as one where the greatest volume of trash is produced consequently having the highest impact on the City's storm water catch basins. Our streets flood every winter, causing traffic, accidents, and in some cases loss of life.

 I have asked til I'am blue in the face for the resources that were promised, in the form of street cleaning which would correct and improve the blight, neglected, unsafe, and filthy conditions.

The area I've reported is ""Western Avenue between Florence Avenue and 108th Street""...they put up signs between 92nd Street and Century no Parking 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM Sept 23, 2016 West side of Street, and Sept 30, 2016 for East side of Western ave, for one day which was Friday, ""then they didn't even clean the streets"", just inconvenienced people for 12 hours. There was no collaboration between City Services Departments, Sanitation, Street Services and LADOT. 

The signs were posted only to generate complaints (so they wouldn't have to clean that corridor) not to clean our community. What a slap in the face of tax payers..

WE NEED A PLAN TO CLEAN AND CORRECT THE BLIGHT AND DIRTY CONDITIONS NOT JUST DOCUMENT THEM."
"63","Kim T.","LA Sanitation - We've had our feuds over the dump... But I really appreciate all that you guys and gals do. Seriously..."
"63","Sharon W.","I like Kim T. thank LA Sanitation for the hard work they do, but wonder How can the Department of Sanitation, Board of Public Works, and Bureau  of Street Services help to develop and implement an effective system of coordinated enforcement for the City's Quality of life laws?

Then use those resources for enforcement and elimination of unsanitary conditions of blight and uncleanliness across South Los Angeles Communities (Major Corridor of Western Ave) and foster greater collaborations with the public to improve livability across the city."
"63","Kelly L.","For those saying it's not being cleaned up, you are right, at least not in an organized action plan way. My personal solution is to constantly report it through the 311 app. It is not the best solution, but they do come and clean up garbage/dumping, fix potholes, etc. It is a constant battle and until they begin to implement a plan this is  the solution I use."
"63","Amy H.","I have reading the complaints and distrust and it really is sad.  I guess when you let the City get as neglected and dirty as LA is, there is a lot of pent up frustration.  But instead of complaining and accusing the mayor of some conspiracy, what are YOU doing to make your community better and cleaner?  If you aren't part of the solution then maybe you are also part of the problem?

The City did this research so they could come up with a plan to begin addressing the problems with blight.   This frankly is long overdue and I am glad they are starting.  While I do agree that the map and coding of streets is not accurate, it is up to the residents to HELP the Sanitation Department get it right.  And it would be even more productive to get involved and use the MyLA311 ap, find out who you need to call in what situations, build a case to help Code Enforcement (by taking pictures, logging contacts with the property owners, etc) and pick up litter when you see it.

The ""costs"" we pay for our trash is low compared to the damage our excessive consumption plays on the environment.  Maybe if we all focused on some efforts to ""reduce""  our own waste footprint would also help this problem, volunteer for local clean ups, etc. we would see some results rather than over rely on cash-strapped City services.

With that said, the City MUST begin budgeting to add more Code Enforcement personnel to tackle the problem of property owners neglecting their responsibility and upkeep. Code Enforcement could be a money maker with all of the illegal dumping and bad commercial real estate players. 

We also need to have triple the public trash bins and even recycling next to them.  Perhaps create zones where there is a lot of fast food and convenience stores which have excessive packaging--maybe an added consumption fee knowing there is more chance of litter with the mobility of food.

Also I see a lot of business sweeping their sidewalk debris into the street.  They are assuming that the street cleaning trucks will get to it but they are contaminating storm drains.  There should be more outreach and enforcement there as well.  I wish the MyLA311 ap had a section to report that offense.  Happens on Pico every day in Mid city to downtown. 

Thanks to the Mayor and his staff for finally tackling this problem."
"63","Kathryn K.","Sanitation Encourages Recycling - Up to FIVE BLUE BINS per Service Location no additional charge for the bins or the pick up.   If you have a cracked can, missing lid, or held together with duct tape, get a free replacement for black, green or blue bins delivered to you and they are FREE."
"63","Randy F.","Won't u join me in picking up trash when you walk, jog, take the dogs for a stroll or simply walk out to yr car? Here is what i picked up within a half mile of my three mile ""slog""! Lots of liquor bottles, fast food wrappers, cigarette packages etc  in the beautiful grassy medians that NEED MOWING! ;-)"
"63","Debra M.","I would encourage everyone to contact their local neighborhood council, many NCs are participating in the Clean Streets LA clean up. If you are in Los Feliz our neighborhood clean up will be held November 6th. More info to follow."
"63","Anne C.","Kathryn Kato, I'm surprised that the bins are free.  I called a couple months ago and was told we had to pay for them. I'll call again armed with this new information. Thanks!"
"63","Julia C.","Everyday I walk my little dog Darma 3 x and am picking up trash along the curbs along 25th street, along my street, Myler and elsewhere. I don't understand how people can just leave their trash on the curb so much around here. When I grew up in Detroit, the ladies swept the sidewalk in front of their homes. People took pride in where they lived. Clean streets deter crime and have a healthy look."
"63","Janet D.","Since the City of LA is no longer doing much street sweeping, it's up to all of us to get out and keep our gutters swept clean. Too many people in may neighborhood, especially those without gardeners, just let debris collect. I hate knowing that all of this crud is going into the ocean. Come on, everyone, it's just a quick exercise workout. Show a little caring and awareness."
"63","Lee M.","Broadway between Century & Colden the median haven't been maintain in years... oh yeah not to mention we didn't even get our streets paved this year"
"63","Angela M.","My alley is always full of garbage and furniture, pot holes everywhere! Garcetti only cares to set himself up for the senate or congress! He's awful. Mitchell Schwartz is a better choice will truly work to get rents out of control building ect back under control! We don't want Los Angeles to become San Francisco!"
"63","Erin Z.","I decided to sweep up our side of the street where the cul-de-sac on Tyler Street is. The gardeners on each side don't clean up the dirt and sludge, so now it looks much better."
"63","cartellia b.","call 311 or report to city council members' office."
"63","Robyn M.","What can be done to stop people from living in motor homes on residential streets? First the last 2 months one family with 3 cars (1 new without plates) moved onto Hauser Blvd. Between Rodeo and Coliseum. They move a few feet  every 3-4 days. This week a second motor home showed up. How do we control more motor homes from moving in so we don't devalue our properties, while the Mayor is cleaning the sidewalks"
"63","Sharon W.","About what can be done about the mobile homes.  Earlier this year there was a REPEL of Municipal Code Ordinance Section 85.02 which prohibited the use of private and public streets and parking lots for habitation. Go to cityclerkconnect and see City Council file: 14-1057-S1 for a motion that the Homeless Committee of the City Council is putting forth asking for a resolution to address the problem.

Follow the above file and motion being put forth by Council Member Marqueece Harris- Dawson who is trying to address the problem.  Pray his motion gets a majority YES vote when it comes before the entire 15 City Council Members for a vote. Make sure you and your neighbors are present to make your concerns known when the public notice comes up for public opinion.

Also, If the people are littering and causing a noise nuisance your can call the noise nuisance department of the police department.  But if they are just parked in front of your residence and not being a nuisance and moving every 72 hours there is very little you can do under the existing laws.  When street cleaning days come and they have to move, just make sure you put your car in front of your own house, but remember to move every 72 hours."
"63","Leslie E.","Do the street cleaners even come any more?  I haven't see any in ages."
"63","Mitchell B.","what about broken down cars with bumpers on the ground and broken windshield?  Need to get it to move"
"63","Stacie F.","Robyn M. - I live in Mar Vista and our councilman's office requested we get a certain number of signatures on a petition to have signs restricting parking during certain hours put up on our street. It actually worked - I was shocked. If you only have one or two motor homes on your street though, they may not do it. We had like 10 of them end to end on Culver Blvd."
"63","Sharon W.","Leslie, Street sweeping is one of the most Basic Service of all City Services, and every neighborhood should get street sweeping once a week.
 Leslie down load the myla311 app and every time your local neighborhood doesn't get street cleaning report it. You will get a confirmation tracking number. Encourage your neighbor's to do the same."
"63","Teresa Williams","I could have saved them the trouble of driving through my neighborhood: red, no surprise there."
"63","Mark A.","There's a big downside to having Weekly street sweeping of your street; 
and that is the resulting NO Parking signs that keep one side of the street clear of parked cars during the sweeping period - typically 2 to 4 hours - one Day a Week.  The other side of the street is swept on the next day.

2 bad consequences: 

1.  the other side of the street (non-swept side) gets
all parked-up during the sweeping interval on the sweeping side of the street.

2.  the Parking Ticket that you're bound to get when you forget about what day it is, or the time of the sweeping.  The question is not IF I get such a parking ticket, but WHEN.

My advice, be careful what you wish for.

BTW, I have seen a street sweeper come by on our block -- even
though we don't have designated no parking street sweeping signs."
"63","Michael P.","Shifty architects of this Clean Streets/311 app. Yet another ""trash"" 311 request was closed, saying it was completed, without being so. They closed case 1-32951128 claiming it was cleaned up, yet the EXACT same trash is still there on the SAME day it was supposedly cleaned up. Who's getting paid for not doing their job? This is the issue I'd like to start taking to the media as I'm saving each instance this happens. I now have two closed tickets when work hasn't been completed."
"63","Sharon W.","Hi Mark A, from Central Del Rey, I live in South LA, and I would trade with you in a heart beat to get regular street cleaning. The corridor surrounding my neighborhood never gets cleaned, so people know they can put their crappy cars up for sale, park their inoperable old broken down cars, set up residence in Mobil Homes and Vans on the street, never move them, without ever getting a ticket.

So trash, dirt, and debris and unsanitary conditions accumulates around the vehicles and end up on our side walks, in our yards and in our lungs, causing asthma and other respiratory diseases.  The debris clogs up our grids and sewer run off drains, and when it rains the streets flood, causing traffic gridlock, damage to our vehicles, and car accidents.

 So street cleaning is a basic City Service that our tax dollars pay for that is essential to keep our streets clean and healthy and increase our quality of life.
 So, Yes be careful for that you don't wish for."
"63","DJ P.","Sharon:  There is an ordinance that cars can't be parked for more than 72 hours.  Call the city and have them ticketed!"
"63","Sharon W.","Hi Michael, I had 2 tickets closed out last week with incomplete service. Improvement is definitely needed in the 311 system."
"63","Sharon W.","Thank You DJP, but LADOT doesn't show up, it took me over a month to get a vehicle towed, in meanwhile trash, dirt and unsanitary conditions accumulated."
"63","Michael P.","Sharon, that's terrible! Take pictures and keep a record. This is the 2nd time in less than a month they've lied to me. They ended up cleaning ny alleyway this morning after I filed another 311, and then I saw a city worker driving around afterward. It'll happen again, we just need to add them all up if they don't do what they say they will."
"63","Abigail J.","Tried the site today 1/2/17) and it does not appear to be working..."
"63","Heather N.","Streets won't be clean until the homeless are gone. That will never happen. And now Garcetti is allowing unlimited street vendors."
"63","Marshall B.","Sounds like you need to come to our meeting. I have found that Sanitation will not go into the alleys. I have an alley behind my house and we neighbors keep it up. One of our goals is working with sanitation more to get more cleaning. Yes the problem is the homeless that create the trash. I have the ones by my house trash bags and they used them and helped me clean up the area. Keep in touch with us. I am waiting for James to confirm our meeting for this weekend."
"63","Sharon W.","I know there is a lot of people who make a living as street vendors and the City Council is considering the establishment of street vending districts that call for a permit and registration. My question is, will taxes be collected, and who will pick up the litter, debris and trash left behind by these street vendors? Will it be the Department of Sanitations Job? or Bureau of Street Services? We already have a problem with lack of street sweeping and cleaning of our major corridors, they are in horrible condition. Who will regulate the vendors? Our police are already overwhelmed. Should street vending be legalized?"
"63","Heather N.","The Street vendors are going to continue to pour their oil down street drains and serve food to unsuspecting customers without having to wash their hands etc.  our city is on its way to looking like Tijuana or Bombay. Those who break our laws are either not punished or actually rewarded while taxpaying law-abiding citizens have to pay up and shut up. We can't even use our local parks without fear of being harassed or hurt by violent mentally ill homeless addicts. The encampments have taken over the city and Garcetti's solution is to spend 1 billion dollars to build 10,000 units for them when we in fact have near 80,000 homeless in the city- many of whom refuse to get clean and work. 35% of them are from out of state too and continue to pour in for the endless  ""free"" benefits. Thanks to prop 47, we get burglarized and our cars broken into and the crooks don't have to go to jail. 
Until voters start voting tough on law and order and understand that criminals don't want to stop stealing and the majority of homeless do not want to work, things will only get worse. 
Garcetti is going to win because there is no better option and he has Caruso's money behind him."

"64","Marcos Lua","the manger should report this to the police. otherwise those people will come back."
"64","Oscar Sanchez","That's a fallacy. If you report it to the police it does not mean it will not happen again. I live in an apartment and if I know I will be getting important mail. I check the mail constantly. If I'm getting a large package I usually have it sent to work (check with your boss if thats OK) or I'll have it mailed to a friend's place who has a better mail situation. Then... Make sure the doors are getting locked to the building. Also career criminals stick to their profession and in the area they are familiar with (they know they have a better chance of getting away with it).

"75","Richard Bourne","Sadly the pressure on MacArthur Park to gentrify are just too great.  If it wasn't constantly trashed, full of homeless, smelling of human excrement, and prone to violence it property values would go way up.  Development would move in and people would be displaced.

There isn't a way to make it any nicer than it is AND preserve it for the extremely low income renters and homeless people who currently live there.  Keep it as it is or watch it turn into another echo park.  Anyone owning property there will get a windfall while anyone renting well below market rates will get shafted."
"75","Richard Bourne","Andrea P.
Hopefully some of those crazies can stay away from the HSR meeting.  Alternative E2 would be the fastest route and the least expensive to construct, so it would be the best for the 35 million california tax payers.  Yet it would block the view of a few rich people of a drainage ditch and so they whine."
"75","Katherine B.","I have had my business right across from the park for over 26 years, We have never really had any ""bad"" encounters until about two months ago. Homeless in droves camped right in front of our business with their tents and ""belongings"". These are not ""friendly"" homeless. They are doing drugs, going to the bathroom  in a bucket and throwing it out into the street, performing sex acts in their tents, and defacing buildings right in front of us and blocking the city sidewalk, making the residents have to walk out into the street to pass. It has gotten really bad, really quick. Someone told me that because of the apartments being renovated downtown, they are pushing the homeless out and into our community. Anyway it is really sad AND really maddening. The police try to keep it under control, but their hands are tied. They arrest them when they have issue to, but then then they are right back out. One of them stabbed another in the chest, they took her away and now she is back. They do routine checks, trying to get them housing, but they always refuse. I do not know what the answer is, but something has to be done...soon. why can't the city turn some old abandoned buildings into shelters or something. I have made several requests to 311 about the situation....always get a response weeks later that the request has been closed. Closed? They are still there. We find hypodermic needles in our trash bin....I could go on....LA take the bling fold off and take responsibility for your city."

Screw you."
"75","John G.","Yes, MacArthur Park is basically a s##thole, and has been the entire 39 years I have lived in Los Angeles. You just noticed? There are dozens and dozens of homeless people all living in or near the park, and it's a drug supermarket, probably run by gangs. People live there, people die there. Did you know this is the part of the city with the densest population? 1 million people live in that square mile. They're all dirt poor, because all the employers are basically running slaves. Did you know how many businesses there are in this city who pay cash under the table, and observe no labor laws whatsoever? It's not just one, or two, or three, or four problems. The sickness is built right into the neighborhood. Likewise, there are no quick fixes, either. Your yuppie solutions all sound a lot like Neo-Fascism, and they show how little you know."
"75","Michael D.","I really don't understand why this message regarding  MacArthur Park is even on this site as it is quite a stretch to include MacArthur Park as part of our San Pedro coastal neighborhood area.  MacArthur Park is a landmark for downtown and it is very sad the the neighbors around it are not able to help the city and law enforcement clean it up. It's not like the city of Los Angeles doesn't take more than their fair share of the Harbor Area tax $$. Now they are pinging the people in our neighborhood who stay involved in our community about problems 20 miles away from San Pedro."
"75","Greg S.","Exactly, this forum is for our neighborhoods and not a LA wide forum. let's keep it focused. thanks"
"75","John G.","People get ""friended"" into an account here, my contact lives in the valley and I live not too far from the MacArthur Park neighborhood, in urban Los Angeles. All around here is sidewalk tent cities, ""statistics"" say homelessness is up 12%, whatever that means. NIMBY's are just being exclusive and turning their backs. It's a huge problem, and I have seen the failings of an Institutional approach. A band-aid is not going to be of any help, when the entire fabric of the society is this damaged. People talk all the time about ""food deserts"", where the liquor store market is the only food sources locally, but what about it also being a ""job desert""? Where the only available work, which is scarce, is for part-time, minimum wage hours? I would point out also, that Social Services is only a few blocks from MacArthur, on 6th St.--where you get food stamps, even if you have a crappy job. This is a low income neighborhood, because employers get away with paying low incomes. It's allright to do so in this political/Industrial environment. Cops make great money, by comparison."
"75","Luis N.","Will there be a written summary of what transpired at this meeting?"
"75","Darryl K.","Wow, suddenly Councilmember Gil Cedillo is all interested in MacArthur Park after three  and a half years of letting it become a trash heap. Might it be cuz Gilberto is facing a tough challenger this March 2017 for his CD 1 council seat. He ignores the Westlake and Pico-Union neighborhoods for three and a half years but now that he has a formidable opponent next spring in Josef Bray-Ali he comes bearing gifts and making promises. So Gilberto brings his ""dog and pony show"" to MacArthur Park, making promises that he will instantly break after being re-elected. Shameful."
"75","Jonathan Mayhugh","To anyone interested this was posted online. I found it informative and should like to pass it on."
"75","Tom T.","@Darryl:  Agreed.  I can think of little good to say about Cedillo...  I do hope they vote him out!"
"75","Milo Imrie","As much as it would be nice to make MacArthur park feel like Central Park I think it would be wrong to use cash and ""developments"" to push out the current population.  If we just push them out they become someone else's problem, as they have apparently become ours as a result of developments Downtown.  They need to be re-integrated into society, treated for their illnesses, or prosecuted for their crimes, if any. We should be grateful that MacArthur Park is a central gathering point for that population, it gives us an opportunity to reach many affected people at once, when the time comes that we have a solution for them.

The longtime residents commenting here are on track (no surprise), if a little hopeless in tone (for which I don't blame them).  This place has always been a problem and superficial, symptomatic treatments won't last.  Unless we put some brains to a real solution, we'll be spending money the City doesn't have.

Besides that, I pass through there often and while it isn't pretty I think that y'all proposing that ""the drugs"" and ""the gangs"" are the sole problem or considering it an apocalyptic scenario are in fact obscuring the issue.  There *are* families and soccer games and kids playing pokemon and so on.  Worse is to list the street vending and marginalized folks trying to earn some income without resorting to serious crime among the true sources of the problem.  Those are symptoms at worst, and might even make a sense of community possible that isn't otherwise, if everything has to happen behind a storefront."
"75","Betty J White","Yes! The street vendors and folks at the lake, incl. day laborers and homeless folks ARE this community. And the further end of the park is esp. family friendly, you're right. 

If anything I've noticed that the homeless population in this neighborhood is docile and usually a bit drunk at most, withstanding the guy lighting buildings on fire of course. Even the sexual harassers (of which there are many) apologize if you call them out! Haha –– Now if we could just cut down on all the litter..."
"75","Neighborhood Prosecutor LAPD Rampart Andrew Said","Hi Betty,  
If you are interested in reducing the litter in the neighborhood, we are planning several community cleanups in the area.  If you are interested in participating, please e-mail me: andrew.said@lacity.org  Thanks,  Andrew"
"75","Heather N.","As far as the homeless goes, the city won't do anything about them because the ACLU will sue the city and win. In case you all didn't know, the homeless have the right to live in the streets and piss and shit in the street and MacArthur Park and anywhere else they want. Drug addicts can use drugs and they won't be arrested thanks to Prop 47-and btw watch out for Prop 57 coming up on the ballot (I'm voting NO on Prop 57), which will only make things worse. Garcetti's plan is to build housing but it won't work and they only people who will benefit from it are his developer buddies. This city like the rest of America has a DRUG epidemic going on. 95% of meth and heroin comes from guess where? It comes from our southern border which is why it needs to be more secure-to keep out the DRUGS. and don't say it's about demand because drugs will always be in demand,they need to be kept out of our cities in the first place. The market is flooded with it which is why the drugs are so cheap. 5 bucks buys an addict meth-enough to keep them going a day or two. 
Our politicians don't seem to think that ""low level offenders"" aka drug addicts and thieves are a threat to society or deserve to be in jail and off the streets. If you want things to change then stop voting for politicians who coddle criminals. Most of the homeless are addicted..it's very sad but they do not want help. Unless changes are made on a federal or state level, the drug and homeless problem in LA will only get exponentially worse. 

Btw read this article about how Garcetti's homeless plan will affect YOU and your pocket.

""If all the taxes on the November ballot are approved by the voters, our proportionate share will be $1.6 billion.  To put this into everyday terms, this amounts to $400 for each of the City’s 4 million residents and over $1,100 for the average family.  This increase is also the equivalent of ramping up our sales tax up to 11.7% or increasing our property taxes by 31%. ""

"75","Andrew H.","Drug addiction is primarily a health problem and not a criminal matter.  Over a quarter of all United States inmates are in jail for drug related charges at an average cost to taxpayers of 32K per inmate per year, and much higher in California.  This money should be spent for treatment of the underlying problem and continuing education and outreach programs.  We need to emulate other countries that stress treatment rather then mindless incarceration and that have proven to have demonstrably better results."

"75","Heather N.","It's a nice idea Andrew but you're forgetting that they refuse treatment and outreach. 
Robit, I'm not mean, I just don't think that I should be the one to pay for the basic human stuff needed by 42,000 homeless people (and counting)- many of whom have made poor life choices over and over and over again. We actually have a very generous system. Go to Africa, the middle east, central America, South America, or Africa...You think they get welfare like general relief, EBT cards, and free health care and endless ambulance rides to the ER? You think they get free clothes and food from local food banks?"

"75","Patricia M.","There are more people living in MacArthur park per square foot than in Mumbai India. Housing for low to no income is not only necessary but mandatory for common human decency. When you bow out a homeless encampment, like refugee encampment, they disperse throughout the city and on overpasses, under freeways etc.  It is a community and government choice.
I ing"
"75","Liz C.","Regarding the comment a few above...Personally, I Don't appreciate reading the racist and negative comments from members on Nextdoor in what is suppose to be a place we can exchange issues and ideas and gather with our neighbors and nearby communities and representatives to come up with positive ideas to make our local neighborhoods a safer and better place to live. If you are not going to say nothing nice, why say it at all. The comment about deporting illegals to Mexico, is unnecessary. First of all, all Latinos in the US are not from Mexico nor illegal, so stop trying to send everyone to Mexico. MacArthur Park is flooded with crime, drugs and homeless from all ethnic backgrounds and very little of them are from Mexico. FYI-Most folks that hang out there are from Central and South America. The park is located in an area that is primarily dominated by Central American and South Americans. States like Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, etc. So before opening your mouth and sticking your foot in it with a comment of that sort, get your info straight. Regardless of where the people are from that are hanging out at the park or loitering. What L.A needs is more jobs, counseling, education, drug rehab centers and professional and community outreach to these folks. Affordable housing needs to be increased. Clean up the park, enforce curfew hours, added security. Add a police substation in the park. Reduce and limit the vendors allowed in the area who are generating so much more foot and auto traffic. The area is out of control and needs a serious lift."

Liz, 
How do you make a homeless drug addict go to the drug rehab center?  Do you know how much outreach is already done and how often they are told no thanks? How do you make the addict go to counseling or a job? 
Do you know that LAPD don't arrest people for using drugs or being in possession of drugs? Do you know that LAPD can't make a homeless person or any person leave the park or break down their tent or move their property?"

"75","Milo Imrie","Heather if anyone is getting ejected for being unpleasant it's gonna be you before the homeless lol.

You are trying to catch a baseball with a closed fist.

Your drug control theory is a proven failure in a society like ours.  Draconian measures that would make even you hesitate are in place all over asia but The Spice Must Flow.  You said it yourself: the demand isn't going anywhere.  Try and choke the supply and you will only make the commodity more precious.  With a park full of desperate addicts (if it is really as pervasive as you decribe) who just got knocked off their budget and their schedule, your plan will have us right back in the 1980s.

Open your hands and catch the ball.  Embrace the reality of the human motivations that put them there and only then can you control the issue.  The outreach we do try fails because it is shallow, from what I have seen.  Connection with someone on the phone, maybe a temporary pass for a few nights at a shelter, then a dead end.

If you want them off hard drugs they need intensive medical care and supervision, not a motel.  I've detoxed from lesser evils and if I hadn't been in jail I would still be a slave to them.  Opiate withdrawal can literally kill you, meth withdrawal is a misery at least, I don't know about the potential lethality.

If it is true that LAPD won't lock them up for possession etc (probaby because of space and budget problems, not being ""soft,"" get real) then we haven't given them a realistic option besides stringing themselves along, as far as I'm aware."

I see what LA is trying to do, with their beautification projects and I'm all for it. but try driving through it during day time and look around...I was stuck in a 2 block length of traffic for 15 minutes while waiting for a green light - No Thanks.."
"75","Andrew H.","Yes, Heather, not only is it a good idea but it's being effectively implemented in many countries.  What is the point of locking someone up for six months on petty drug charges when you can spend the exact same money and provide drug treatment and occupational training for six months.  A addict is an addict is an addict without treatment.  The current system locks someone up for six months without treating the problem and addicts come right back out and commit petty crimes to get drugs.  Even if the success rate is a measly 25%, that's better than near zero with incarceration and at the same expense.  By the way, it's not a voluntary program..."
"75","Heather N.","How can you spend that exact same money on treatment and training if they refuse? They have the right to refuse."
"75","Maria Sanchez","Bruce M you are so on the money! It'll suck like NY and Chicago!! (Was just in both cities). MacArthur Park has always been this way what's wrong with it? Actually it's improved! People who  know the area know how to navigate around certain elements. That's city life!"
"75","Andrew H.","It's for addicts that want treatment and training in lieu of incarceration.  There are plenty of good people that didn't grow up with Ma and Pa Walton as their parents;have little or no support system and just need some help and guidance to get their life on track.  Let's help them get out of the system, take care of their children, and into a productive tax paying life."
"75","Steve G.","Why is this topic on the Sherman Oaks Nextdoor link? Well, since we're being asked: I lived near MacArthur Park as a child, remembering it as Westlake Park. (Lafayette Park was Eastlake). The neighborhood was immigrant then, mostly European (hence: Langer's Deli from 1947). There was a boathouse from which you could rent boats for the lake. The park has always hosted a mix of derelicts and slackers, along with strolling families and a lunch crowd. As downtown areas become gentrified, neighborhood improvement money follows real estate money, so the Park may be policed more and cleaned up. Think Venice, Echo Park, Bunker Hill, etc. Now that there's a Metro station there I may visit and go to Langer's again without worrying about safe parking. 

  It's informative though to learn how increased taxes on homeowners may do little to improve the social problems in distant parts of the city. Our San Fernando Valley receives far less in city services than we contribute to the tax base for our crumbling, if gentrifying, inner city. Look at MacArthur/Westlake Park history back to 1880s to read about the dreams people once held for our sunny, unspoiled Southern California opportunity."

With my experiences with people from around the world, we would have headed south where there were opportunities to provide for our families.

It's fine for 'illegals' to work in the fields, clean our houses, keep our sewers reamed out, and do our gardening, but they're not welcome in our parks????  And by the way, go to Serrania Park, where there are no 'illegals', and you will find litter.

I don't have this gene, but I know that we need these people who have it.  
However, in my perfect world, there would be no Beverly Hills, Holmby Hills, etc.  Why do we still need palaces?

No fear mongering intended at all.  Given that we do live in a major city in earthquake territory, it would behove us all to get ourselves prepared and trained to know what to do in such an event. The magnitude 6.7 Northridge Earthquake took several lives, injured throusands and caused $23 Billion in damages, and that was not a major quake.

"81","Koreatown Resident","We can treat the people themselves compassionately but also let the city know that this is not acceptable.  I do see these areas monitored constantly by bike police.  

Once the Pearl construction site at 7th and Hobart is completed, there may be pressure to clear up 7th street.  Right now, the north side of 7th street between Kingsley and the Hobart is mostly parking garages or vacant lots, so it is an attractive place to ""squat"".  

The Pio Pico Library and it's available bathrooms are another reason why the encampments along 7th occur."
"81","Picasso Wife","Let the city know that this is not acceptable? Homelessness and poverty are already against the law in Los Angeles. 

Where do you suggest all of these people with no homes, go? Can you imagine what you would do if you had no money and no place to live? If these circumstances were to befall yourself, wouldn't you also wish to use the bathroom on a regular basis?

Poverty and homelessness are structural, social problems which must be dealt with comprehensively. Lack of a Living Wage and lack of Affordable Housing is the problem. 

For Citizens to wish away or want to ""clear up"", the ugliness of poverty and despair while ignoring the capitalist propagation of racism and economic inequality is loathsome. Are you aware that most people without homes are Women and Children escaping abuse? The majority of homeless men are disabled Veterans.

"81","Koreatown Resident","well, drug use and drug sales on the street are not acceptable by law.  Trash and sewage in the open are also not acceptable.  It is ok to have a dialogue about this and still be a compassionate human,"
"81","Picasso Wife","Indeed. Dialogues are good. Curious though? How do you know drug deals are taking place amongst those with no homes? You know homeless people are not dealers, correct?

As far as trash and sewage are concerned, can we have a discussion as to communicating with the city in regards to portable toilets? Do the street sweepers not drive along 6th St.? 

Perhaps, some of us can organize to meet on weekends and pick up garbage? I know people in nearby communities who have done this. Maybe, we could go to these encampments and speak to the people living there to discuss our concerns?"
"81","Koreatown Resident","I was responding to the original poster who stated, ""I've already witnessed arguments and drug use / dealing while driving/walking by"".

No, I will not be picking up trash because what looks to me like trash is actually the homeless person's prized belonging and I feel that would start a conflict.  

I think residents who have people camping, grilling, parking, sleeping, and using the toilet in the grass outside their apartments have a right to be upset and to ask the city for help.  Personally, I would not be ok with this. Yes, we should also ask the homeless if they need food or water.  

Honestly, I feel like this is a problem that will shift elsewhere because that particular area of 6th/7th street is gentrifying rapidly.  

The causes of the problem are too large for any of us to solve individually, but I think it helps if we alert the police while also using our political power to vote for candidates/measures that support a solution to homelessness in Los Angeles County.  And of course, showing humanity toward anyone who seeks it."
"81","Picasso Wife","Agree 100%, Adrian. Where are all of these people supposed to go, if they are to be ""cleared away""? Do the Residents who complain, think of this? Do they expect People without homes to be picked up and thrown into the garbage?

I love the link for the tiny homes. If given vacant lots, these dwellings could be parked to form a clean and aesthetic village. People can then purchase and consume their drugs indoors, like the rest of us. But alas, too many fragile eyes cannot bear the sight:

"81","Picasso Wife","As far as the LAPD are concerned, they already know homelessness is a big problem in the City of Los Angeles. Which is why they organize programs like this:

2016 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count
http://www.theycountwillyou.org/

I took part in this year's Homeless Count. Before our teams went out to count, we listened to an LAPD Detective with a great deal of information and compassion. He mentioned that he has gone on to earn a Master's Degree in Public Policy to help him understand how best to combat the problem. 

This Detective informed that many of the homeless people in our area suffer from Schizophrenia. He also mentioned the fact that there are not nearly enough available beds in area shelters to accommodate the vast numbers of people without homes."
"81","Koreatown Resident","A way to support a solution to the problem could be to vote for Proposition H this November (on the ballot in Los Angeles) that taxes homeowners to support the homeless."
"81","Koreatown Resident","@picassowife - you want respect for the homeless but you have no respect for the posters on this board? Where do you live and how many homeless are outside your place right now?"
"81","Koreatown Resident","And there are lots of reasons to not be comfortable with people doing H or meth in front of your house... I think it's reasonable to admit that there are many disadvantages of drug use and that it should be monitored by the police."
"81","Picasso Wife","@Koreatown Resident, when have I failed to show respect for the posters on this board? I've not used any curse words or made any threats. Merely, I've asked questions?

I live at Wilshire and Normandie."
"81","Picasso Wife","As far as the drug use is concerned, the solution is to provide low-income housing, MediCare for All and to end the War on Drugs. 

There are many advantages in using drugs. You know, penicillin, antibiotics? Are you saying the cops should come over to my house every time I take my morning, afternoon and evening doses of prescription pills?

Sorry, I'm being snarky again. But not disrespectful. Merely, I want you to try and consider the fact that the LAPD already know about homelessness and drug sales. They don't need to monitor anything. 

Homelessness is a huge, systemic problem and there are no quick solutions. Sorry, that you are made so uncomfortable as a result. Think how uncomfortable it must be to have to sleep on the sidewalk?"
"81","Koreatown Resident","@PicassoWife - My post, where I asked you a question was flagged as inappropriate, so clearly it is possible that ""merely asking questions"" is an aggressive act by any poster. 

Second, it is really not useful to keep assuming things about posters that want to discuss the problem (that I have a problem with penicillin? lol, I mentioned H and meth).  

I am also not interested in sweeping the problem under the rug (""sorry that you are made so uncomfortable"" -- I'm not uncomfortable but I feel this is a legitimate issue and everyone else in this neighborhood is going to view homeless camps as a disadvantage) , and the fact that we can't discuss the problem here respectfully is a problem.  

Finally, I posed the question (aggressively, my sincere apology) about your situation because you seem so willing to paint me and other posters as uncaring human beings the second we notice or inquire about homeless, so I want to know about what the front yard of your home/apartment looks like.  MIne has homeless people in front of it.

Thanks,"
"81","Picasso Wife","I didn't flag your post. My questions were aggressive? Okay.

Don't agree that I've been disrespectful. Yes, lets discuss this problem but, let us also be cognizant as to reality. The police already know there are many homeless people in the city of Los Angeles. We have more homeless people than any other city in the United States.

"81","Picasso Wife","KR, I knew you weren't talking about antibiotics or penicillin. I was indeed being a smart alec. Trying to make a point. 

We all use drugs. Pharmacology is good science. Merely, some of us have privacy, others do not. It's a Class thing. My snark emerged not because people were noticing or inquiring about homeless people in our neighborhood. But rather, because some spoke of the need to ""clear"" these needy human beings away due to how unpleasant they are to look at."
"81","Matt Stauffer","With a few minor exceptions, the city is prohibited by a court order from just arbitrarily clearing out an encampment. If a camp is blocking public access or represents a health or safety hazard then they can come in with an appropriate amount of notice. But they have to save and store the belongings they find and give notice to where the owners can collect them later. It's a process.

The best thing you can do is vote against the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative in March and vote for the homeless housing bond in November. The NII will drastically reduce the number of housing units built in the city, which will further price people out of their homes. The bond measure, while not perfect (from what I've seen), will give the city the money to acquire land and then lease it to homeless housing developers."

They tend to aggressively attack each other when they get bigger.  Now my turtle is the size of a dinner plate.   I fed it turtle pellets for the first 10 years.  Then live whole snails with shells from my garden.  Now he eats pieces of meat (chicken, beef, fish raw or cooked).  I feed them when they are in the water.   They don't need much.  I had mine in an aquarium for the first 5 years then a small pond the next 10 years in my atrium.  I now have a giant planter dish with water and rocks he goes in and out of. He has the run of my house and loves my cats.  Comes when I call him....  I have an enclosed atrium in my house.  Don't put them outside - as the Raccoon or Possum will eat them.  Keep them enclosed in a cage if you are going to put them outside or they will end up eaten.....   When it gets cold they hibernate.  When it is warm they are active.  They are reptiles......  I feed them mostly turtle pellets from the pet store - a few once a week.  Don't overfeed or they get really big fast."

"88","Richard Bourne","What do you mean by preferential parking?  Do you want to have a residential parking district where you have to pay for passes each year to park on the street over night.  What about for longer than 2 hours?  Any time of day?  

Who is taking your parking spaces anyway?  On my street it's locals who are keeping beat up cars that barely run.  They only move once a week for street cleaning.  Residential parking programs wont stop that unless the user fees are high."
"88","OC LA","Preferential parking is where residents are issued 2-3 parking passes for their street per year I believe it's 34 dollars for Los Angeles. Anyways, only designated vehicles that reside in said areas are allowed to park there. The city also provides visitor passes in case you have a visitor. I have the same issue on my block, people owning three or more old vehicles which they rotate only for street sweeping. It's extremely annoying."
"88","Richard Bourne","I doubt 34 dollars a year is going to stop it.  It will just make it more difficult for businesses in the area to attract people from around the city."

"88","OC LA","Great! I also mentioned potholes and sidewalks in terrible shape. Our areas could use some tlc and I'm glad people are speaking up."
"88","Michelle Cote","Parking is godawful in Ktown and it's encouraging double parking which further blocks up our streets.  With the density of our neighborhood, we are seeing ambulances and fire trucks multiple times a week - when double parkers and emergency vehicles have to fight for the same space, it's the residents that lose."
"88","Matt Stauffer","Richard is correct. Unless permits are expensive enough to manage the demand against the limited supply of curbside parking, the issues with access and double parking will not be resolved. Reserved curbside spaces should probably be more expensive than the nearby private garages, which can run between $112 and $187 monthly.  $34 for the entire year doesn't reflect the true value of a curbside space and won't deter people from keeping their 2nd and 3rd cars on the street."
"88","Richard Bourne","While I think $34 a year is trivially low, it might be something to get the ball rolling.  

In addition there are a lot of streets where there is less parking for no real reason.  Large no parking spaces between cars because I guess people in LA don't know how to parallel park?  Also many streets are wide enough to allow angled parking which would create up to twice as many parking spaces.

$34 dollars a year wont even cover the cost of enforcement, but $75 a month would and provide a surplus to fix sidewalks/streets"
"88","Greg Rapp","One key thing to take into consideration is limiting the amount of parking spaces per household. West Hollywood allows one or two street permits per household. If we implemented a one permit per household then it would go far to help limit the amount of stationary secondary vehicles."
"88","Richard Bourne","The problem with an abatrary limit to the number of vehicles per household is that then 3 bedroom apartments are the same a 1bed bachelors.  Ktown is littered with different types and sizes of apartments.  Just because 3 people are sharing a kitchen shouldnt mean they have to share a parking spot.

Price parking fairly and people will make their own choice based on their need.  Use the revenue to improve the neighborhood or refund some property tax to residents."

That doesn't look like a gang tag--our local gangs are 18th street  which tag with 18  and XVIII; and White Fence Westside Locos who usually tag WFWL.  This, from my limited gang experience is a personal tag, his way of saying ""Look I am here, I exist.""  Politely asking him not sit on your porch and to please smoke elsewhere may be the best thing to do, just say, ""Please don't  sit, smoke pot and tag here. Thank you.""  If Don't escalate it, don't make threats, just ask him nicely, and keep asking each time you see him. If it continues, without mentioning it to him, contact out senior lead officer at Olympic Division, explain the situation, and ask for increased drive bys of squad cars during the hours you have seen him.

He is trespassing, so technically you could have him arrested, but why put another kid into the jail system? He is probably sitting there to get away form something unpleasant at home. An occasional cop in the hood may keep him from getting to comfortable.You may want to  to get bright motion detector lights that will discourage him from sitting there and a sign that says ""video surveillance."" The alternative of course is to build a fence.

Hopefully he is not homeless and just sitting there to get away from whatever is bugging him at home.  The flip side is that by sitting on you steps he is learning your routines, and when you are hone or not. So yes, every time you see hi, ask him to please leave. If he didn't have in head phones, I'd suggesting blasting opera."

"92","Chief Nnamdi A. E.","Dear All:

Informing City Officials of the specific needs of the Community and creating an avenue to inform the Community of opportunities of employment and/or other avenues of collaboration or befitting from the City are not mutually exclusive in terms of the functions of a neighborhood council.

What I read from Mr. Alex I. sound and seem like Neighborhood Councils are and must be anti-City - I apologize if I read him wrong - but I want to opine that this should not be the correct angle to view the relationship.  I believe there should be some form of symbiosis between the two, I think Kim K. is on the right angle.

Having said that, I would like to volunteer Part-Time Teaching service in any subjects or areas of Law, Legal Clinics, and/or English as a second language, at our Community College, Pierce.  If anyone can facilitate this, do let me know - my contact number is: (818) 232-2480.

When people are educated as to How To, then they will be equipped with the information, and upon application for the City Job their qualifications and other criteria will be scrutinized before they are considered for the specific jobs.

I still do not see what the gripe is in a forum that is geared towards giving people the necessary information to be able to take advantage of opportunities {jobs, inclusive}, available with the City.  Of course the City would hire individuals based on their qualifications, as such attending a seminar or forum to learn how to apply for these jobs is hardly the same as acquiring connections inside.

The freeway projects are of course necessary, even badly needed, but don't excite me quite as much personally, since I'm a lifelong rail enthusiast and therefore obviously much more interested in those projects."

"98","Matt Stauffer","^ That's why we should repeal the 2/3s requirement. Also ridership is down from 30 years ago, but up from 20 years ago. http://laist.com/2016/01/28/why_is_las_metro_ridership_declinin.php"
"98","Matt Stauffer","You also have to consider that the mid-80s is when voters decided to downzone the entire city. Fewer potential passengers per square mile is of course going to limit the effectiveness of fixed route transit service. We need to repeal Prop.

"98","Mitchell Schwartz","Please see article in LA Times, on Jan 26 of this year. Big ridership declines in spite of billions spent. I'm for more mass transit, but this is loaded w lard. Id rather use that money for , homeless, more police, fixing parks and infrastructure."
"98","Matt Stauffer","And please see the link I shared which is a direct response to that article. The Times cherry-picked the absolute highest ridership year which came right after a ballot measure which kept transit fares at 50 cents. And it glosses over the fact that transit ridership is down across the country, indicating that it the declines are spurred by larger trends. It's also counting the billions Metro has/is spending against it without accounting for the fact that a lot of those billions are still being spent building the projects.

That article came out in January before the Expo and Gold Line extensions opened, and while Crenshaw/LAX, the Regional Connector, and the Airport Connector are still under construction. How will ridership change after those projects are open? How will ridership improve if we continue to limit residential and commercial density? How will voting against Measure R2 improve ridership? And if we don't expand the transit network, what are you willing to do to enhance mobility as the county population continues to grow? Double down on cars? Widening the freeways again? Is that the best use of scarce dollars?"
"98","Mitchell Schwartz","Hi, like I said, I supported Measure R, which helped build these lines. Though I do not think the subway along Wilshire is money well spent. It's over 10 b dollars, and does not go to the sea.
But, you can't look at this spending in a vacuum. If we had unlimited money, then sure, build as many subways and light rail as possible. But we have many other problems that need addressing, like homeless, infrastructure, parks, pensions, police, fire etc
So..we need to prioritize what it is we want to spend money on.
To answer your questions what Id do for traffic. No, not double down on cars or more highways. But more bus lines, like the rapid line along Wilshire or the Orange line in the Valley. Buses down the 405 in dedicated lanes. 
Also, ride sharing should start to kick in within the next few years, as UBER and LYFT are investing lots of money into this area.
But remember, the sales tax is regressive. Ridership is down...or static. Our resources are not unlimited, so let's prioritize.
Interesting discussion.
Thank you."
"98","Matt Stauffer","I agree you can't look at spending in a vacuum, but you also can't wear blinders. There will be a separate ballot measure for homelessness. We can vote for both. I realize ballot box budgeting is less than ideal; you'll never get a policy that's crafted exactly the way you want. But that's the way it is right now. If it were up to me I'd eliminate most of the highway projects in this plan except for ExpressLanes. But we also desperately need the transit projects that are bundled with the highway projects, and if we don't vote for them all this year, I don't know when we might get anything else done. I don't imagine the homelessness measure will be perfect but we need to get something done sooner rather than later.

Measure R2 has important bus projects: bus rapid transit along Lincoln Blvd., a BRT along Vermont between Hollywood Blvd. and the Green Line, BRT connecting the North Hollywod Orange/Red Line station with the Pasadena Gold Line station, and grade-separating portions of the Orange Line.

Wilshire is already one of the most congested roadways and busways. The new bus-only lanes help a little bit but that corridor is ready to be converted to rail. And the project is already planned and approved. And for what it's worth the most recent number I found was a little over $7 billion. I'd love for it to eventually reach the ocean, but I can't pretend like connecting downtown, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Century City, Beverly Hills, and UCLA by heavy rail isn't going to be a boon for the region.

And let's remember that the city's Olympics bid relies heavily on our plans for transit investment. Passing R2 will better enable us to handle the Olympics should we win them, and it will better enable us to get money out of the feds to speed up the biggest projects and get them done by 2024. We have to come to the table showing we've already made a local commitment."
"98","Mitchell Schwartz","Ah, the OLYMPICS. Of which every one in the last 55 years has been over budget.,except one. LA 84. And that's because LA passed an initiative  that we would NOT be responsible for any cost over runs. We had good leaders back then. We need the same assurances now, that we will not be responsible for potentially billions in overrns.
Please remember, Boston won the chance to host but the voters said they didn't want to risk it. 
2/3 of Brazilians regret hosting the Olympics.
Let's let the voters of LA decide if we want to be responsible for billions in overruns. The Mayor will be long gone by then. He owes it to LA  to let us decide, just like we decided in 1984."
"98","Alexander Barber","Thank you for sharing your thoughts everybody! Wow, I did not expect this much interest in the topic.

Now, I will be the first to admit that I am a lifelong rail enthusiast, but don't mistake that for bias.  My love for rail travel, despite its origins in the very first years of my life, well before my capacity for thought was able to reach beyond ""BIG TRAIN!!"" actually stands up remarkably well to the deeper reflection, internal scrutiny, and critical thought of rail's relative merits in my adult years. 

Here are a few thoughts in response to your comments.

1. An interesting thing about rail ridership to keep in mind is that the more robust and interconnected that network becomes, the more ridership will go up on ALL the lines.  It is a network, so somebody with a Metro rail line next to their house now may not ride it now because they work somewhere not served by Metro, but may be able to ditch their car and ride daily if a new line in build that allows them to connect to their work. 

2. Busses - Just, no.. Every single dollar invested in public transit in LA between 1960 and 1980 was spend on busses and freeways and look where that line of thinking has gotten us, nearly every inch of our city is covered in dreary asphalt and concrete, which often costs more to remove than to install, the air quality is terrible, especially compared to the Bay Area, and the freeways are gridlocked from dawn to dusk.  Bus service is generally only good for one thing in a vast, sprawling megacity like ours, which is filling in last mile gaps in a rail network, in areas that are not densely populated enough to link with rail.  

The only exception to this that I can think of would be dedicated busways such as the orange and silver lines, although in my opinion those should generally be transitioned to light rail service, so long as the ridership is sufficient to justify the additional expense.  A good example of this transition is the orange line, which has been so successful compared to other metro bus routes that even the double length busses used are no longer sufficient to handle the route's passenger volume, which is why the transition to rail has become a clearly important objective for Metro. 

3. Street busses take three to five times as long to get around as cars do during rush hours, and offer no tangible benefits over driving for those who can afford to own cars.  Generally the people who rely the most on public transit are students and working stiffs like me, as well as retirees and veterans on fixed incomes.  Remember that when the pacific electric was abandoned, unemployment rates in transit dependent areas like Watts skyrocketed practically overnight, as commutes that took under an hour on the big red cars could take three hours or more by bus in rush hour traffic.  

Everybody's time has value, and public policy that ignores the needs of working people, students, veterans, and retirees living on fixed income is a loud statement saying that those people's TIME is not as valuable as everybody else's.  It's wrong - everybody's time is valuable, because every human being has great value. 

4. The tax is indeed regressive, and regressive taxes do indeed tend to be a greater burden on the poor than the rich or middle class. I personally think it is ridiculous that our city and county budgets are not being used to build rail, but if Los Angeles thinks we need to spend 4 billion dollars a year on the LAPD to keep our city safe, I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I don't know everything. And like Mitchell said, that money IS sorely needed to address homelessness, pay firefighters, and make our sidewalks wheelchair friendly already. Therefore if there was ever a time for a regressive sales tax though, this would be it as the tax would leave the 8 billion dollar LA city budget intact, and still allow these projects to relieve us from gridlock. Those of us with little to spare need these trains the most, and since it seems like nobody wants their property taxes funding them, this is the only way.  Perhaps our only chance. 

5. To those of you who voted for the original measure R before I moved here, thank you.  Sincerely.  If those projects had not been funded, I would not be able to make it in this city.  I do everything I can to try and have as much of a positive impact on my adopted home of LA as I possibly can, I really do, and I would like to think that I sometimes do, but I am not arrogant enough to think for a second that this makes me special.  There are LOADS of people like me - both young and old - many of whom are probably far more successful in instituting positive change for the city than I am.  People who also may not have been able to stay and fight for the city we love if voters had not overwhelmingly reversed the awful and shortsighted public policies of the 60's, 70's and 80's that made such of a mess out of our beloved home. 

6. The zoning issues are a good point, and need to be addressed by city council as soon as possible - although I would personally implore the council to revise the poorly thought-out zoning restrictions without abridging any public green space or legal protections for iconic historical buildings.  I think that looking to Uber and Lyft for an additional source of taxation revenue to fund public transit projects is a fantastic idea, although most definitely not exclusively, since they - knowing those companies - will undoubtedly pass as many of those additional tax burdens onto their already underpaid drivers as possible.  

7. I know it can be useful to make up your own statistics in a debate, but that's not fair to anybody. We are all entitled to our own opinions, but not our own facts. These are the actual factuals:

RAIL Ridership across all categories  (heavy rail, commuter rail, light rail, etc..) has swelled DRAMATICALLY since 1990 across the United States. 

BUS ridership has declined or stayed flat despite population growth since 1990. 

Since overall transit ridership mashes these two data sets together, it is important to look at them separately to get an accurate picture of the long term trend, as the two modes are VERY different from each other, and viewed as such by most.  I'd have to crunch some numbers to determine if Americans are ditching busses faster than they are flocking to rail or vice versa, but there is no question - they are doing both of those things en mass, and the trend in favor of rail has remained remarkably consistent over the past 26 years.

8. The purple line doesn't go to the sea, but Santa Monica beach is hardly the only important destination between Western Avenue and Ocean.  Wilshire Boulevard is packed with jobs and lots of workers will benefit from the subway, not to mention the enormous number of people commuting to the Westwood VA and UCLA each morning. 

9. I'm pretty sure that widening the freeways only makes traffic congestion worse.  I'd get further into the theory of human error based entropic interference that I've been developing to prove this to be true, but my hands are starting to hurt, and I'm about to go down to the subway where I will lose service. 

10. Crenshaw/LAX alignment is already under construction.  As much as I wish it did, it will not serve WeHo.  The northern terminus will connect with the Expo line, but go no further than that, unfortunately.  It could, of course be extended to the north in the future if the funds are available to do so.

11. I too am also FIRMLY opposed to the Neighborhood Integrity initiative.  I don't know anything about the Build Better LA, though, and will have to do some research before I can form a fair opinion.

Very lively and interesting discussion indeed.  If nothing else, I hope you will all see that I have put a great deal of thought and consideration into my strong support for this ballot measure."
"98","Alexander Barber","TLDR: LA is moving in the right direction - let's keep it that way."
"98","Matt Stauffer","I don't think Boston is capable of hosting the Olympics even if they wanted to. Most polls I've seen here show overwhelming support for the games. But I, too, would like some assurances. The biggest bargaining chip we had in 1984 (and 1932 as well) is that no other cities wanted to host the games back then, so we had the IOC over a barrel and could make a strong demand like that.

Alexander, for number 9, look up induced demand and triple convergence. Expanding capacity on a roadway does not relieve congestion because the extra capacity immediately gets used up by drivers generating new trips, drivers re-timing their existing trips from off-peak to peak hours, and transit riders switching to driving. This is also why new transit projects don't relieve traffic congestion--all the people who switched from driving to transit will be replaced by other drivers. With roadway expansions the benefit is in greater throughput--more cars can now pass through, but travel times aren't any faster. With transit projects, the benefit is people now have an alternative to driving. And the transportation system overall can support more total trips. The Expo Line to the beach isn't allowing me to trade car trips for train trips, it's allowing me to make new trips I never would have made before. And that's a good thing."
"98","Alexander Barber","Matt, that's definitely a good thing.  For me, it's both.  The Expo line has allowed me to replace car trips with train trips, while also allowing me to visit the lovely city of Santa Monica at impossibly congested times when I wouldn't dare go near the 10.  And I can drink as much as I want at Harvelle's without having to fret about getting home safely or forking over more than I can afford for an uber. 

It's more than just new trips.  I think a lot of people, especially millennials like myself, are beginning to grow disillusioned with car culture.  I started taking Amtrak/Metrolink for my epic commute to my great new job in Irvine from our neighborhood instead of driving, and it's already proven almost life-changing.

Instead of wearing down my clutch on a grueling 2+ hour trudge down the interstate at the busiest hours of the day I have a relaxing hour long air conditioned train trip which I can spend reading, napping, zoning out and listening to Eliot Smith, working on my laptop, or just shooting the shit with friendly and interesting people from all over Southern California commuting to their respective jobs.  

Just this morning I had a fascinating extended conversation with the two lovely people seated in the same booth as I - a Disneyland Janitor from Jalisco and a lady on her way to set up at Comic-Con in San Diego who was involved in the Power Rangers franchise in some capacity;  As a result of meeting those two people, I learned that somebody has made the questionable decision to invent a 'Pokemon Go' dating app, and that a not insignificant number of people ask to have their ashes scattered in and around Disney in their will, which is generally honored by their loved ones without the permission of the park and occasionally resulting in the closure of popular rides. 

Not necessarily information that I will be able to use in any capacity, but I'm glad to have met them nonetheless. 

It's about patterns too, transit ridership can be exponential, I think, as more people plan their lives around affordable light rail, people in their respective social, familial, and business related networks will be more likely to replace their car trips with train trips as well, be it through word of mouth, riding in groups, or routinely visiting the same places.  I don't think more trains will only mean more trips, although even if it did only result in more trips like you say at least rail transit can be easily scaled to meet increasing demand at a fraction of the cost of widening roadways and such.

Some additional travel will indeed occur as transit becomes less of a hassle, but mostly just BETTER trips, and a greater concentration of economic growth in proximity to train stations, making the city a more community oriented, interactive, environmentally friendly, convenient, and walkable place to live."
"98","Alexander Barber","Triple convergence definitely seems to support my theory that widening freeways worsens traffic congestion, at least in this article about it: https://walkablestreets.wordpress.com/1994/08/18/the-triple-convergence/

The cool thing about rail systems is that they are managed as a cohesive whole, and therefore not subject to the rational self interest of the individual at the expense of the common good described by the theory of triple convergence, which I most certainly believe to be accurate in regards to freeways.  I generally set waze to avoid freeways for this reason exactly, when I have to go somewhere not adjacent to the rail network."
"98","Alexander Barber","Induced demand is a very interesting concept as described here as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#Sources_of_induced_traffic
Thanks for pointing me in the right direction and introducing me to those concepts, Matt, they will undoubtedly be extremely useful to me in any further examination of #9."
"98","Richard Bourne","Buses, Buses, Buses!  Everyone seems to like buses because of low start up costs.  Some people like them because they want to put the poor in their place rather than investing in the public good.  What never gets covered is that buses cost more to operate than trains. So while you get that low start up cost and quick build time, you end up putting a hole in your budget each and every year for the rest of time when you decide to use buses.  

A rail vehicle and a bus cost similar amounts to operate per hour, most of the cost is the driver and maintenance.  The rail vehicle though can carry more people, so has a lower cost per passenger.  The rail vehicle goes faster, so has an even lower cost per passenger mile.  Rail is more attractive, so it gets even more riders, further lowering costs.  

In addition to higher cost per passenger mile, buses also destroy the roads they ride on(like any heavy vehicle) adding costs to the maintenance budget for roads.  

Every year LA county spends 1.5 billion dollars subsidizing its bus routes.  Hundreds of millions of dollars go to repairing the roads worn down by buses.  The rail systems also need to be subsidized, but they require far less subsidy per passenger mile.  By building rail now, we not only make the city more live-able, we also lower the operating costs for the future."
"98","Alexander Barber","Richard, EXACTLY!  I could not possibly agree more. I'm not sure if the push for busses over light rail since the 1950s (especially between 1960 and 1990 here in LA, *cough*Pacific*cough*Electric) has been a contributing factor towards staggering economic inequality or just a symptom of it, but what I DO know is that they are NOT the solution.  TRAINS TRAINS TRAINS, please."

If the coming generations don't like what Metro does with the tax revenue, they would be free to vote to repeal it.  But car culture in its current form is neither scalable to population growth nor sustainable."

Some people can't afford them, by the way!

It's also a pain in the neck for last minute overnight guests."
"106","Alexander Barber","Those are all valid concerns Jay, and thank you for the feedback! Here's my thinking;

Parking permits are purchased from the city for $36 per year.  $36 is not nothing, but a single parking ticket is nearly TWICE the amount of a single parking ticket.  A single tow is more than TEN TIMES the cost of the permit.  

I can assure you that I'm personally quite firmly in the 99% - I'm a full time college student, I have a ton of debt, and it's a struggle just to pay my rent each month.  

I am DROWNING in parking tickets, some of them legitimate, most of them issued frivolously, and I am certainly not alone in such a predicament.  The relentless expense and wasted time required to deal with them is not a burden I can continue to bear.

Parking tickets are nothing more than a small hassle and a few scribbles of a pen in a checkbook for those more financially secure than I, but the impact of the same fines on somebody like myself who cannot simply pay to make them go away is exponentially more harmful.  

The city will double the amount of the ticket in no time at all, send the tickets to collections, mess up my credit, and impound and auction off my car to pay the fines they pulled out of thin air, and they will keep the change.  They can do that to anybody parked on city streets after they have accumulated just five tickets, and the last time I was ticketed I awoke to find that some jerk gave me THREE - three parking tickets for ONE violation, at the same time.

My car is one of about five valuable things that I own, and you can believe that I won't be reimbursed by my insurance if the city is the thief that took the thing.

If you have lived in this neighborhood in excess of one month, own a car which you park on the street, and have not yet received a parking ticket, I salute you.  You would be the first person that I knew of to be so fortunate.  

So, the impact on those of us with very little cash to spare was actually the whole reason I began thinking about this in the first place.  This would save everybody who lives here A LOT OF HARD-EARNED MONEY.  

You are also right that permit parking can be a hassle for 'last minute overnight guests'. I have been one of those guests myself when visiting friends elsewhere in the city and yes, it was a hassle but...

1.) You can easily plan ahead and get some guest parking permits in advance. 

2.) We live just blocks from the Vermont/Beverly Metro Station, which is awesome.  

3.) It's already essentially impossible for anybody, residents and visitors alike, to find parking after 5PM.  I don't even drive after 3 anymore because every time I get home late, I am forced to park a half mile away, or park in a legally questionable space and wake up to find my car has been impounded and I'm out another 400 bucks (give or take) that I simply do not have. 

Quite frankly, the one-time hassle faced by non-residents spending the night in the neighborhood pales in comparison to the hassle all of us who live and park here all year round, and have to endure that same hassle every single night when we get home from work or school.  

There should be no contest between a one-time inconvenience for a visitor and an expensive, grueling, daily struggle to find a place to park where you won't get a sixty dollar ticket or find your car has been impounded when you wake up. 

Finally, we're actually supposed to have the permits already, nobody does though because at present, lacking overnight parking restrictions, there are no tangible benefits to getting one.  

Technically, in our neighborhood the curbside parking is marked as '2-hour' parking - at least during the daytime, although I'm sure almost everybody, including myself, routinely use the same parking spaces for longer than that.  I've spoken to at least three people in my building who have been ticketed for parking over 2 hours, which LADOT is legally entitled to do to non-permitted vehicles because we are within the permit parking district.  

It is nothing more than mercy or good fortune that this limit is only sporadically enforced, and that could change at any time if LADOT elects to stop using merciful discretion in the enforcement of that specific law.

I hope that I was able to adequately address your concerns here, Jay. 

Keep them coming! :)"
"106","Jay Herman","Alexander,  Thanks for the response (and your hard work).

I'm just not understanding the need.  Are people parking on your street/in your neighborhood that don't live there?  If not, you have caused everyone to get a permit and haven't lessened the demand for parking and the poor and/or uninformed will still get the tickets.

If so, why are they there at night?"
"106","Abhi Irina","Jay, how can anyone be ""uniformed""? There are sighs all over the place informing everyone!
There are plenty of vehicles that should not be here for example: people who are running used car sales business on my street and parking 5 vehicles on the street with a tow truck, just moving them around to avoid tickets. People running back yard repair shop, and park broken vehicles on the street.
There is a car with licence plate from Wisconsin, that is parking here since yesterday and blocking my driveway, probably one of those AirBnB people vising.
If everyone got a permit, right there and then it would illuminate all this junk from the street, leave the space for people who actually live here and need the parking when they come home after work.
Unfortunately Alexander is not in my district, I would love if someone would join me in pushing for that zoning here as well."
"106","Alexander Barber","Another excellent question, Jay, and one that had actually occurred to me as well.  

However unlikely it might be, it is technically possible that every single car parked in our neighborhood on a given night belongs to a full time resident.  

Keeping that (remarkably improbable) hypothetical scenario in mind, the worst case scenario outcome for extending the overnight parking restrictions would be that it does not improve the availability of parking spaces, and does nothing more than insulate us from 2-hour parking tickets that are occasionally issued.

That would suck, but think about the probability of that first part being the case.. it'd be extremely difficult to figure out a precise number but the chance that every single person parking in our area actually living here would have to be one in one-hundred at least, and probably far, far more than that - perhaps 1/10,000, 1/100,000.

The much more likely scenario, which I myself believe to be the case, is that a fair portion of the vehicles parked on our streets overnight belong to people living in other adjacent neighborhoods suffering from parking congestion worse even than our own, parking one or more car/s in our neighborhood and walking to wherever they live.  

Since we are surrounded on all sides by other neighborhoods with similar parking shortages, this is extremely likely.  Just the other night, arriving home late from babysitting for a friend, I parked a half mile away underneath the 101 in an adjacent neighborhood - so a lot of people routinely need to do this.

The better case scenario, which is far more likely - is that the overnight restriction will cull a percentage (10-15% if I had to guess) of the total vehicles that can park in our neighborhood overnight, putting an end to the awful game of 'musical chairs' everybody presently endures.  

Admittedly, this would be an experiment.  I can't say with absolute certainty that it will have the desired effect, but it is also an experiment that has been done in other areas of the city with overwhelmingly positive results in most cases.  

For actions such as the one that I now propose, I have found it wise to base my decisions on the cost/benefit ratio of the choice in question.  

The worst case scenario here would be that things remain approximately the same as they are now.  The best case scenario would save everybody in our neighborhood enormous quantities of both time and money.  

The best case scenario would cause a considerable number of quantifiable quality of life improvements for us and our neighbors, the worst case would cause hardly any changes at all, and the best case scenario is FAR, far more probable than the worst.  

The potential costs are trampled by the weight of the potential benefits for this, so it is my opinion that this experiment is most decidedly worth a shot.

I do hope you agree! :)"
"106","Alexander Barber","Yeah too bad about that Abhi!  A passionate advocate for this like yourself would help me out with this a LOT.  Permit district 46 ends just shy of Studio District S extending no further than Rosewood to the north."
"106","Abhi Irina","Also, I hear that there is moratorium currently on any new parking permit areas/extensions, is this true?"
"106","Alexander Barber","That would be news to me, did you see that on a news site you could link to?  The staffer I spoke with over in Mitch O'Farrell's office when I was tracking down the district map didn't seem to think so, they were very supportive of the idea and didn't mention anything about it at the time."
"106","Abhi Irina","Good to know, I am hopeful!
After all Melrose Hill is just a block away."
"106","Alexander Barber","Here's an at least semi-accurate map of PPD 46 that I pieced together from the very out of date map I got from city hall and my combing the area on foot and recording changes from the map I was given.  This shows all of the current overnight permit parking streets, not any of the proposed extensions that I am working on.

Edit: I haven't had time to check for new signs north of Beverly yet, but everything else should be accurate.

"106","Jay Herman","Alexender, it sounded like you were casting a wide net, so other neighborhood parkers might be in same boat and parking district.  I just don't know the area dilineations.  

Also, I think you are saying the overnight permit will do away with the two hour limits?  Is that right?   I'm guessing Abhi doesn't have that or her repair / used car lot issue would go away.  

By uninformed, I was alluding to language issues."
"106","Alexander Barber","Yes, unless I am mistaken, the time limits apply to everybody during the posted hours - except for permit holders, who can be there as long as they like, as long as its not street sweeping day.  

Abhi lives just outside the permit district though so I can't speak to what the posted signage is in her area or what if any parts of the CVC the parking hogs are violating.

As for a wide net, you're absolutely right - a wide net catches more. ;)"
"106","Alexander Barber","Oh and the language thing, I'm not sure why the signage in LA isn't multilingual already since we live in such a diverse city.  

That being said, I doubt there are many licensed car owners in the neighborhood who don't understand the meaning of the parking signs.  

When I moved to Costa Rica for a while it didn't take me long at all to figure out what the various traffic and parking signs meant, within a week or two despite speaking almost no Spanish when I first arrived.  Conversational language skills took a good bit longer to get down though, of course."
"106","Jay Herman","You said the magic words, ""licensed car owners."""
"106","Alexander Barber","Unlicensed drivers too.. Anybody driving in LA who didn't know what any of the street signs said would have their car impounded in a matter of weeks if not days.  

Unless there are a bunch of multiple car owning foreign billionaires hiding in our area who can't read a single word of English yet can somehow manage to write huge checks to the department of transportation for all of their tickets and get their vehicles out of impound without the ability to communicate with the impound clerk.. 

Believing that were the case would be a pill I'd have a mighty hard time swallowing without some credible evidence."
"106","Alexander Barber","My point being - are there a few people in LA who can't read signs? Probably. But if any of them had a car at any point, rest assured that their cars are LLOOOONNNNNGGG gone by now.  Parking enforcement is ruthless."
"106","Laura K.","Yeap that is out of date and if they are actually enforcing it then it's not being enforced on my street. I am on South Edgemont and no one BUT ME has a permit down here. This has to stop. I am so sick of this crap. Today was street cleaning day and every Wednesday and Friday I witness so much CRAP. Why do I feel I am the only one who even cares. Mmmm maybe because I am the one who has to walk a million miles to get home everyday."
"106","Laura K.","I have to address a concern in the earlier posts. I want parking permits in my area because I have people on my street who have 10-15 cars and they shuffle them every street cleaning day. If it is after 4pm I can forget getting a parking spot at all. I have a chop shop on my street and I have people who live upwards to 10 people to an apartment. I HAVE to pay for a permit because if I don't I won't have a spot at all.  There have been times when I had to work late and had to drive around for an hour looking for spots....and even some nights where I have had to park on Vermont at a parking meter overnight and then get up early to get my car before tow time. The parking is out of hand and the parking on the grass makes it feel like a 3rd world country.  So yes, if I have to pay for parking permits then I feel they need to as well.  As I am writing this, I just witnessed ONE person move nine cars and he's not done yet. I am just lucky I was working from home today or else I'd be out of luck."
"106","Alexander Barber","Laura, I've had to park on Vermont quite a few times myself, and wake up at the crack of dawn to move it before it turns into a no stopping zone.. Just the worst.  

I really can't believe that when people like ourselves are having an impossible time finding parking on a daily basis that there are people literally running used car lots and chop shops with no lot of their own. 

I'm gonna do some lawyering and find out what laws they're breaking so maybe we can get some relief by making them stop doing that hopefully sooner than we can get the overnight restrictions expanded."
"106","Alexander Barber","BINGO! Laura, I found what we're looking for.  The parking hogs in your area are in BLATANT, easily verifiable, objective and self-evident violation of LAMC 80.73.1 sections (a), (b), (c), and (d).

"106","Bill Snitzer","Alexander, I've noticed that often times the streets with overnight parking restrictions are the streets with all single family homes. I feel that they've lobbied the city to keep the people who live on neighboring streets where there are more multi-family dwellings from parking on their streets. This creates an artificial parking shortage in the district.
I think more relief would come if those overnight parking restrictions were lifted, not added. The public streets are for all of us and the permit price would be an added burden on the families already struggling with increasing rents in the area.
Also, the laws you listed above should absolutely be enforced."
"106","Laura K.","Of the laws were enforced I bet we would not need the stickers. Good idea about putting the law in the windshield"
"106","Alexander Barber","Thanks for the input, Bill! 

Personally, I am not so sure that we wouldn't need the permits if there were no overnight parking restrictions to begin with, and here's why - I don't think there's anything 'artificial' about our parking shortages at all.  

Perhaps you are familiar with the neighborhood of Alamitos Beach? 

Alamitos Beach is a densely populated area along East Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach.  It is also the only place I have lived where the parking situation is worse than it is here.

In Long Beach, at least in the aforementioned neighborhood, there are no overnight parking restrictions whatsoever.  My former neighbors in Alamitos Beach have done EVERYTHING else imaginable to alleviate the parking shortages there - everything short of creating a permit parking district, that is.

Throughout the past 20 years the residents of Long Beach city council district 2 have:

1.) Restricted most residential streets to one-way traffic only.

2.) Increased the density of available parking spaces by changing the traditional parallel to the curb parking to side to side parking on at least one side of the street.

3.) A retired Newport Beach police officer, one of my neighbors at the time, actually went out and did a complete audit of red-curbed areas, and lobbied the Long Beach city council to reduce the length of excessively long red curbs in the neighborhood, adding a few additional parking spaces to each block.

That list is not exhaustive, and reflects only the information provided to me by long time residents of the area with whom I conversed on the subject.  

In spite of the tireless efforts of my neighbors to alleviate the shortage of parking (without creating a permit parking district), it was negligibly less than impossible to find parking on any of the neighborhood streets after 2:30 in the afternoon on every single day of the week.

When I was lucky, I would be able to find parking in Bixby Park, about a 15 minute walk from where I lived.  

More often than not, however, after driving in circles for upwards of 45 minutes looking for a single unoccupied space, I would give up, exhausted and ready for bed, and park illegally in the alleyway between 1st and 2nd streets, leaving a note with my phone number on my windshield, routinely being awoken at ungodly hours of the night to move my car so it would not get towed. 

A lot of the time I would just spend the night at my younger sister's place in Belmont Shore just so I could close my eyes without the persistent and well justified anxiety of being towed, as I was usually able to find a space near the Belmont Pier that was safe to park in, a few blocks away from her apartment.

There were no chop shops or used car businesses in Alamitos Beach, the Long Beach Municipal Code was widely and ruthlessly enforced, and yet in spite of that and all the work that had been done to address the problem, it was an unreasonable burden to own a car and live in that neighborhood.  

I don't know that a permit parking district would have been able to fully address the shortage of parking in Alamitos Beach, but I do know that they tried EVERYTHING else, and it did not.  

Keep in mind also, Bill, that the financial duress of rising rents and endless stacks of parking tickets is my principal concern in addressing this, as I am one of those residents in the neighborhood who is feeling the squeeze of them both - I am a student, and as I have indicated previously, and I struggle to pay my rent each month

Just as I said to Jay earlier in this thread, I understand that $36 (the cost of an annual parking permit in Los Angeles) is not nothing.  I don't think I even have $36 in the bank right now, quite frankly.  But I also know that $36 is about one-half the cost of a SINGLE city parking citation (one quarter or less once the fine compounds due to non-payment), and one TENTH the cost of a single city impound.  

The first and most obvious compromise would be to petition the city to waive the $36 fee for the issuance of new permits to residents of our area upon presentation of proof of residence in the neighborhood, although I would suspect that it would be more difficult to persuade the council to put up the relevant signage without the incentive of the signs paying for themselves..

A more intelligent compromise that occurred to me would be to charge the $36 for the permits to those who can afford it, and waive or dramatically reduce the cost of the permit for recipients of CalFresh EBT benefits, Medical and other forms of verifiable public assistance.  

In the latter scenario, the city would retain some monetary incentive to pay for the implementation of new signage, while exempting those of us with the least to spare from any new financial burdens.

In the interest of transparency I should disclose that I myself would be one of those who benefited from the waiver of fees for recipients of public assistance - I receive monthly benefits for food though CalFresh/EBT, helping me to make ends meet.  

Since I would be one of the beneficiaries of the latter compromise, I would only be comfortable proceeding with that one upon the agreement/concurrence from one or more of my neighbors, so that the proposal cannot be perceived as self-serving or of conflicting interest.

Thoughts?  I eagerly await further input from you all.  :)"
"106","Janice Wood","If you live within the boundaries of the permit parking district and have your car registered there, you may pay the annual fee and get a permit for the entire district normally. Check with LADOT. They have offices around the City. 
Parking districts are established by petition and single family home blocks are much easier to get signed petitions from. DOT may also be able to give you the petitions you need, but someone will need to go door to door and get them signed. Good luck."
"106","Alexander Barber","Thanks for the info, Janice!  I'd probably be going door to door myself in order to gather the necessary signatures.  I live in the large apartment building on Beverly and Berendo so I'll be starting here, since I won't have to worry about finding somebody to let me in to knock on doors.

Most of the other homes on Berendo are either single family homes or homes that have been converted into multi family apartments, so those shouldn't be too difficult to canvass."
"106","Janice Wood","Again, much luck to you. If you don't get the assistance you need from DOT, you might consider contacting your Council Office. That was very helpful in my neighborhood."
"106","Kirah Tomas","Thanks for the info! And I applaud proposal of trash cans around the neighborhood! Wonderful idea! Such a logical solution to such a horrific problem. I offer my support in any way needed. Please keep us informed of any results. Appreciate what you are doing!!!"
"106","Don Durkee","S s s"
"106","Lisa Derrick","Permit parking will be meaningless because anyone can just park on the parkway/greenbelt/apron, that grass/dirt/weeds between sidewalk and street. Parking enforcement is prohibited from ticketing/enforcement. That parking style is all over Berendo, 1st and 2nd, and is currently allowed because of an ADA lawsuit initiated by UCLA; until all streets in LA are ADA compliant, anyone can park on apron/greenbelt (but no one is allowed to park on their own lawn!).   I don't understand how permit parking would help really, because there are so many older  apt buildings that do not have adequate parking for tenants--they were built for one or two people who might have one car betwen them and now have two or more cars per unit."
"106","Abhi Irina","Lisa read my post above:
""There are plenty of vehicles that should not be here for example: people who are running used car sales business on my street and parking 5 vehicles on the street with a tow truck, just moving them around to avoid tickets. People running back yard repair shop, and park broken vehicles on the street"" ...using streets as their personal storage.
I heard it from other NextDoor people, it is happening a LOT in side streets off of Western."
"106","Randy Votsch","Would this include Edgemont Street?  I tried the permit petition for our block a couple years ago but got little interest. I think our street is the only street in the area that does not require permit now- which means all surrounding streets park on our street now. Never any parking after 4:00.

WOULD LOVE TO EXTEND PERMIT PARKING TO N EDGEMONT STREET- between Beverly and 1st!  The cost of one parking ticket is three times the cost of an annual parking permit. And you can get passes for guests when you need them.  I'm a fan if anyone is interested."
"106","Laura K.","Randy, I am on your street. I feel the exact same. I'm on South Edgemont. Its a nightmare!!!"
"106","Rebecca Berman","I live on Catalina St. and we desperately need these parking permits, I'll help in any way I can!! Just let me know who I need to write to and where I need to show up!"
"106","Lisa Derrick","It looks like only the green lined streets would be permitted, is that correct? Kind of a problem for people who don't live on those (like me for example). I have lived here since January and cannot invite more than one carfull of people over at time, and then only when my sig other is out of town so there is a space in the garage because there is no parking. There is no parking because because people have kids and caretakers who have cars; because two people equals two cars and when the apts were built it was one space, one unit. The unpermitted cars from the special snowflake area would be forced onto other streets (and on the parkway/aprons of your neighborhood where they could not be ticketed or towed, so enjoy that!) What makes  PPD46 more super special than a not-PPD 46?"
"106","Eusebio Aynaga","If the city could expand the permit area south of 1st to 2nd or even 3rd streets. The double parking on sidewalks have gotten out of control and the posts that home owners are installing to prevent people in doing have become an added eyesore."
"106","Lisa Derrick","The parking on greenbelt/parkway/dirt-lawn between street and sidewalk is currently allowed. It will continue even with permit parking --cars parked on greenbelt/apron cannot be ticketed.  I am at a loss as to why you think permit parking is going to solve your nighttime parking problems, but then I live on a high density street with numerous apts and multiifamily homes where each resident has a car. I see the same cars every day parked on the street. It's not like PPD 46 area has a ton of night clubs where visitors are parking in residential neighborhoods and going out drinking and dancing and coming back and (my fave anti-nightclub complaint) ""urinating in the bushes and having sex on the lawns"" (something I have heard for decades living in West Hollywood, Hollywood and Los Feliz, and yet never seen!). The people who are parking at night LIVE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.  So what if one of your neighbors has 6 cars. This is America. You can have six cars, you can have no cars, you can park your 6 cars on the street. Yes, it is a city code violation to have for sale signs on cars, so freaking call parking enforcement and get them ticketed."
"106","Eusebio Aynaga","I know that they are residents that live in the neighborhood. And I also know that LAPD is the only ones who can ticket cars on the sidewalk. All I'm saying is, if they expand the permitted area, it just might (or not) relieve some of the stress of driving endless minutes looking for parking. It has helped the areas where it is permit parking."
"106","Lisa Derrick","Sidewalk is not parkway. Technically parkways are still forbidden but DOT is reluctant to ticket because of the ADA lawsuit (i have called parking enforcement and Mitch O'Farrell's office and they both said no ticketing).  Having lived in many areas with permit parking that are near bars, nightclubs, restaurants, busy shopping etc -- yes it can help. But we don't have that (yet--it's about  3 to 5 years away).   You will be moving the alleged problem of ""not from here ppl parking"" onto other streets (and I doubt it's that out of control), and the residents who live on those streets without permit parking will be further displaced. And um..so why don't you have parking in your building? Oh it was built without parking? Or you have more ppl in your unit than spaces? Do you think you are alone in that? Many, many of your neighbors have that issue, and they are all looking for parking. Permits won't help. Good luck. I am still figuring out how to have more than two people over for dinner--rent paces nearby for the night and shuttle service?"
"106","Angie Kelly","The two hour limit and 6pm is certainly enforced on Raleigh street. A friend was over for a couple hours two weeks ago and got a ticket. I've also seen them go around and put chalk marks on tires, but not lately."
"106","Angie Kelly","One of the issues with the guest permits is that it technically only covers the block/street listed on the permit. When you live on a one block street with not enough parking spaces, a guest could be forced to park on another street and potentially ticketed. And on Thursday nights our street loses several parking spaces to trash cans. 
When it comes to daytime parking, I wish people going to the studio would stop parking on our street. Some days I see cars with 'Major Crimes' on a laminated sign on the dashboard. Sometimes there will be cars with a parking hang tag associated with the studio - it looks different than city tags, perhaps they are official city tags but why would the city issue tags to businesses that have their own parking lot and parking garage?"
"106","Laura K.","I'm Moving... No more headache! It was nice talking to you all. I'm actually very glad that there is a dialogue going on regarding the neighborhood.

There will be an apartment available on South Edgemont in a couple of weeks"

"106","Bill Snitzer","New trash cans yes, parking restrictions no. These vehicles belong to the people who live here. All this would do is make it so everybody has to pay for a permit.  This is not a wealthy neighborhood. STOP."
"106","Alexander Barber","Bill, see the FAQ, I have addressed that concern several times previously, as well as on the FAQ.  At $36, an annual parking permit will cost approximately half of a single parking ticket (about $63).  I should note that I myself am most certainly not wealthy. 

That being said, I will be recording the number of people who decline to sign the petition for this or any other reason, and if the number of ""no's"" is in excess of the number of favorable responses, or close enough to half to merit concern, I will not be filing the petition. 

Although I suspect that will not be the case, if I am mistaken I will refrain from moving forward with the current proposal, and  revise the petition and try again until a proposal with a sufficient majority approval can be identified.  I will, of course, post the response data on here once I have finished canvassing the neighborhood."
"106","Bill Snitzer","For fairness, you should split the trashcan and parking permit issues into two separate petitions.  We do need more trashcans, and I would hate to see people such as myself not sign for more trash cans due to being against the parking issue.

Also, keep in mind you have to apply for a parking permit in-person at one of the service centers, adding more hardship to those who live in the district."
"106","Alexander Barber","Lisa - To answer your questions, yes, my building was built without sufficient parking, as many older LA apartment buildings were, back when one could still get anywhere in LA on the Pacific Electric, and therefore many people did not need cars.  At present, I rent a space about eight blocks away from where I live for about $200 a month.  

It is the closest and cheapest space I could find, and I can't afford it every month, so I'd very much like to be able to park at least within eyesight of where I live for $3 a month instead of $200.  

Admittedly, you're right that this would not address the overall issue of parking in LA, and would indeed likely push some of the parking overflow onto non-permit parking streets, just as the streets in our neighborhood presently host a good deal of the overflow created when other nearby streets initiated permit parking and ours did not.  

But my goal here is to address the immediate problems of those live in my neighborhood right now.  Yes, of course it would make it worse elsewhere, but I'm not a politician and I don't have any influence over the city's overall transit policies, so this is the best solution available to us at this time."
"106","Alexander Barber","You make an excellent point there, Bill.

There are two that can be accessed by the metro nearby, but everybody hates dealing with LADOT, even when it's easy to access, myself included.

I'd be open to splitting the petition into two, one for the uncontroversial trash cans and red curb removal (which would create additional legal parking without any change to the permit parking district), and another later on for the permit parking. 

I could conduct a poll while canvassing for the trash/red curb petition to better inform any future actions regarding the permit parking thing."
"106","Alexander Barber","Also, if you have any ideas as to how we can get LADOT to stop frivolously ticketing us while parked in front of our homes WITHOUT the creation of the overnight parking district, I am all ears."
"106","Alexander Barber","Perhaps we could get the city to issue some sort of 'Resident' sticker free of charge (without any additional parking restrictions) that would require LADOT to stop abusing neighborhood residents with ""Over the Limit"" 2-hour parking tickets?  If we're going to talk about the city needlessly straining those of us with little spare income..."

"108","Shunit Mor-Barak","I strongly recommend Tita Mira's Family Daycare.  It's up north a bit (15-20 minutes from where I live) and run by a husband and wife team.  They recently recruited my boy's old babysitter who is fantastically responsible and they serve nutritious hot meals that even my little picky eater will eat.  My boy now attends a more formal preschool but I'm bringing him back to Tita Mira's during the Summer break because he loves being there so much!  They do yoga, trips to the local farmer's market, gardening in the front yard and playing in the back yard.  They have a nap room, too.  On Fridays they have a movie with popcorn and that's the ONLY TV they watch all week.  I believe she still charged $50 a day or $1000 a week which is pretty inexpensive if you shop around - it works out to be less than $6 an hour? - and I believe the place is open something like 7:30 or 8 -5:30 so it's good for working parents (but please check, it's been a little while so I may be fuzzy on the hours).  That includes the snacks and hot lunch.
I'm the type of person who frequently does yelp reviews when I'm unhappy (or happy) with a place, so you can be sure I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't think the place was great!  :)"

"110","Michael C.","Why on earth is the Reseda Station meeting listed as in Hollywood?"
"110","Kym A.","The bike lanes and walking lanes need to be switched. If the bike lanes were near the street side, cyclists would not have to cross the walkers/runners to go down the apron to cross the street. I am very cautious and always look over my shoulder but have been almost a hit by cyclists a number of times. Although cyclists are supposed to walk their bikes in the cross walk, they never do.
Also, if cyclists were on the side closer to the street, their backs would never be to the road traffic. And, walkers/run news would have more space by the bus side fence in addition to shade under the trees."
"110","Marilyn M.","Michael C, the Reseda Station meeting is at Columbia College Hollywood, which, despite its name, is located on Oxnard Blvd. in Tarzana, close to Reseda Blvd."
"110","Maria C.","None of these stations are of interest to us residents at the end of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.  San Pedro is trying to develop tourist attractions to our area but without rapid transit it will be very difficult.  There are only 3 THREE entry point to our town maybe 4 FOUR if you include the bridges coming through Terminal Island.  Parking is also limited thus some form of easy transit like most other important cities we could achieve the goal of creating more jobs in our area.  Transportation is ESSENCIAL."
"110","Corinne Rogan","Let's do Vermont Wilshire MacArthur pk westlake 7th st"
"110","Jill H.","I heard about this project years ago by the Reseda station.  They have been trying to do this for a long time but there are many problems with it and that is why they stopped at the planning stages.  Cost is a number one issue.  One story rural areas they want to build up into 3 stories or more.  They spoke of stores with apartments above them. Our streets cannot handle that, nor can the neighborhoods.  Our neighborhoods, (West end of the Valley), were involved in the the process of the orange line when they first came to us and wanted to do it.  At first it was very hush hush until we started to make noise.  MTA wanted to do what they wanted without the neighbors input.  We pushed and spoke at many meetings and made them listen to us.  They were never going to put in the bike and pedestrian path as they promised.  Our neighborhoods, meetings and petitions got them to work with us and the city to get them to put them in.  There was never going to be landscaping, Do you notice there is no advertisements on the orange line buses?  There is never any other buses on the line but the orange line buses, they wanted to use the orange line as a thorough fare for other buses.   These were things we fought for.   Even though this meeting is not with the MTA it is with City Planning, we must be cautious of what is up their sleeve.  MTA needs to get their ridership up and backing anything that will crowd our neighborhoods even more is something we must keep an eye on.  Just be cautious of what they want to do in your neighborhood."
"110","Doug C.","I have attended a few of these, and have been sorely disappointed.  A  panel of people from Metro and developers show up, talk amongst themselves, present their plans, show off lovely drawings, promise great things, entertain a few questions, provide stock answers - then leave.  The decisions have already been made.  Money has been invested.  These meetings are window dressing, and are done b/c the law requires them.  
To be fair, the audience isn't much better, with most comments boiling down to ""we don't want it.""  
If you attend, I suggest you temper your expectations.  If you pose questions (or objections), make them to the point, and don't rest until you get an answer."
"110","Len F.","Classic L.A. bureaucracy -- blanket the city with meeting notices without telling non-valley residents why this might be of concern.  

Question:  Why is this of interest to the over-the-hill-gang, e.g., those living in the Westside, San Pedro, Westchester, etc.?"
"110","Vicki V.","that's what i was wondering too...when i lived in the valley, i never saw any notices about what was going on with the orange line"
"110","Kathrine I.","All I can say is we need more public transportation. I would love to have the subway linked to the West Valley. To not drive in traffic anymore would be heaven."
"110","Linda T.","I don't know why it was posted to other area lists but they may be trying to get greater participation and decided widening notification could only increase attendance.   Public transportation by its nature takes people to neighborhoods they don't live in but spend time in.  Making transit stops more interesting enhances the area for the commuters and local residents.  Which helps create a sense of neighborhood and community.  Seeking wide input is commendable."

"110","Daisy L.","One person shared this  with us today: 
 It dumps the worse  unwanted element in our neighborhood. 
It is free for them because if they can not pay for the ride,  the police  do not give them a ticket because, they can not afford to pay and  will not pay the fine anyway. 
We already have a big parking problem  with the apartments homes that do not have sufficient parking and park in front of the homes on Calvert, and the off streets.  And the drug dealers parking in the middle of the street selling drugs.  
Not to mention the big homeless issues. Is this a way to ship them to the valley like they got caught doing over in Hollywood?"

Oh wait- we got ""bike lanes"". They are RARELY used except by tweekers in the middle of the night and for photo ops. Yet there is 11 million dollars for a ridiculous ""bike share"" program. It sure would be nice to have some of the money that is generated by our port used here where we need it"
"110","Jason E.","Not interested in any Orange Line workings.   All current stations are plagued with graffiti and vandalism, which lends to a trashy and third-world feeling.   Clean up your act and get the basics down, like crime and cleanliness.  Shouldn't have to worry about my safety when traveling."
"110","Glenn G.","The entire Orange Line Project was an ill-conceived, traffic-creating so"
"110","Jill H.","Doug C. yes you're right, they really don't care what our input is or what we say.  Like I stated before they are going to do what they want to do regardless.  This is just formality for them.  I have heard they want to turn the orange line into light rail.  Again, this was hush hush.  Now they are slowly mentioning it.  When the Orange line was first in designs, we insisted that they go below grade at the intersections, due to safety issues.  They said it would cost too much.  Florida had the the same line and told the MTA not to do it due to many accidents and deaths.  Florida had to slow the buses down immensely for safety.  MTA ignored their warnings.  Now I understand the MTA wants to speed up the buses on the orange line.  I have recently heard the new line in Santa Monica is charging for parking.  When will they start charging for parking for the rest of the line?   We knew the orange line would bring more homeless and riff raff to our neighborhoods.  It has proven true. Thats going to happen but MTA sped it up with the practices of the orange line.  They don't care what the people want or say.  Please go to these meetings if you can and let them know what you want and how you feel about this new project they plan on.  Nothing good ever comes from an MTA project."
"110","Lisa P.","I love how the Orange line has cleaned up the defunct weed- and trash-strewn railway line with surprisingly diverse landscaping, and it's great to be able to use an east/west bike lane that finally links safely to the Balboa park lanes, as well as bus service to the metro.  (Thanks to Jill, who posted above, about her activities in improving the plan!)  As a Valley person, I can't speak to other dedicated bus lines, but it seems they've done at least some things right on this one.  (Isn't the Van Nuys Flyaway also an MTA project?  I'm sure people can come up with criticisms about that, but I use it all the time to LAX - such a sane and affordable way to get there!)  

I've seen accounts of cost/benefit studies about bus way vs. light rail, and I don't think one can really generalize about the configurations (including above/below grade, readership expectations, etc).  My daily commute causes me to cross the Orange line route twice every day, and the intersections I cross (usually Balboa, Tampa, Lindley) seem well designed in terms of signage and signaling.  If you haven't lived near the Orange Line long enough to be familiar with the before/after versions of the area, you may have assumptions that don't fit this particular situation.  Public transportation has to happen somewhere and sometime, and this particular project seems like a decent implementation of it.  

SYMPATHIES by the way to those outside the SF Valley, regarding the presumably accidental over-posting of this thread.  If I could figure out a way not to ""reply to all,"" and just reply to the Valley-ites, I would..."
"110","Debi B.","Jill is correct.  They are required to have community input, but it doesn't mean that it will make a difference.  It WILL make an impact if there is an OVERWHELMING response to what people articulate they want in their community."
"110","Jill H.","And by the way, when our new councilman, Blumenfield, was elected, his office had no idea about the orange line from the beginning and what we went through with the MTA.  We had to enlighten his people on what went on.  (we don't know if it got to him or not).  When you go to these meetings do not expect council people to back you or agree with your disagreement of part of or the project itself.  Remember, you have to live with it in your neighborhood, they don't.  If you want them to listen to you and your input, get a group together.  They listen when there is more people and more voices.  We had gotten together with 3 or more other neighborhoods and had a very large amount of people to go to meetings and speak up.  We had newspaper articles written and news outlets.  We were instrumental to the point that someone had actually asked us how did you get the MTA to listen and work with you?  They never do that.  Get your neighbors to go to these meetings.  Ask the questions.  Make them give the answers."
"110","Len F.","Interesting, eh?  For those of you with LOTS of time on your hands, take a look at a LENGTHY critique of the L.A. Times article ""Billions Spent But Fewer People Using..."" re the region's transit system :  http://demographia.com/db-rubin-la-transit.pdf.

In essence the author asserts that ""Light and Heavy Rail in Los Angeles are both extremely expensive to build, require very high capital renewal and replacement, take more than a decade to get from concept to operations, and then have poor operating performance.""

Additionally, ""Bus in Los Angeles is relatively inexpensive for capital costs, can be expanded or changed quickly, and posts very good operating results (page 22).""

Think of that when the proposed sales tax increase comes before us next November, not to mention when you ride the billion-buck-plus, near-empty Expo line from Santa Monica (those few who actually ride it)."
"110","Catherine G.","Len- The expo line is so crowded that they have added longer trains.... I am not sure why you feel it is near-empty?  I ride the expo line frequently - and  my husband rides it each day to and from work-  Neither of us have ever been on an empty train -in fact most times I ride it I have to stand most of the way (both  to downtown and Santa Monica)  because it is so crowded."

Most importantly, I stopped taking the orange and red lines due to security concerns.  It just isn't a safe atmosphere.  If it's not making money, shut it down."
"110","Tal A.","Transit is a public service, not a business; there shouldn't be (and fortunately isn't) a profit motive."
"110","Soraya D.","Profitable or not, the Orange Line and subways are heavily used. Be aware that discussion of dedicated busways or light rail sometimes do not bring up the increased high-density housing that will be connected with these projects. Some people may be all for light rail, but not for more high (or higher) rise apartment buildings in their neighborhoods."
"110","Reem B.","The same urban planning concepts that are applicable in the valley around the orange line can be adapted for other neighborhoods. If you're interested in the use of public space, there's no harm in learning what's happening in other neighborhoods. Good design is good design."
"110","Renate C.","I grew up in the Valley but re-located to San Antonio 10 years ago. I've been here for several weeks now visiting my mom and am struck by the parallel conversations being had in both places - the need for more housing vs the impact high density housing has on neighborhoods and their residents.  I attend a lot of these types of workshops in SA and my experience has been that community input is encouraged, but rarely applied.  I look forward to attending one of these workshops to see how it compares."

Interesting, as our whole street was not notified at all and we are the closest to the project.  And yes, the MTA is 'sponsoring' this project.  Which means their funds, their decisions."

It can't hurt to call in and report them though, so if there are enough complaints they might enforce it in the future- and then there's a record of the call should anything unfortunately happen as a result of lack of enforcement (let's hope that's not the case)."

"113","Helge S.","I actually quite enjoy it. A couple years ago we had a better firework in this area then I have ever seen anywhere else. As long as they stop at one point and don't shoot them off all night long all is good. Happy 4th of July :)"

"113","Jessica H.","Well, when your house is the one that gets destroyed from illegal fireworks, like what happened to my parent's house on Mt. Washington, then you might not ever ""enjoy"" that, again. People forget that a fire gets way out of control extremely fast. And, FYI, the fire department delayed sending in their pumper unit, because they didn't want to ""lose"" the two million dollar unit on the ""dead end street"". Houses hadn't risen to the fun over priced amounts that we all enjoy, today. It was not fun. Not one person should light up fireworks on Mt.Washington, ever. It's been almost 20 years but it ruined my parent's  lives. I don't think it was the least bit worth it. They are illegal for a reason."
"113","Dana S.","The city shelters are also packed to the brim with spooked runaway dogs this weekend and so many adoptable pets are put down to make more room.  It's completely preventable and so sad."

“If you’re reading this, we really need your help… our shelter is at capacity, and they had to start euthanizing yesterday for space and the 4th is coming up – if you or anyone you know can FOSTER a dog for just 4 days… ONLY 4 DAYS… you can save a life. 60 dogs generally come in over the 4th – the numbers game does not look good. That means, 60 dogs could be put down for space. If we can find in the entire city of Los Angeles just 30 people that can foster a dog for 4 days… we can save 60 dogs… please please SHARE and spread the word – come in to EV to fill out a foster agreement or go online and bring it to Veronica Perry at the SHELTER – come people – we just need 30 people in this entire big city!"

Sometimes I even wonder if it's fireworks or gun shoots."

"113","danette r.","If only Echo Park residents cared - last night sucked. Tonight will be worse and the police do nothing. Arguably, they have other things to do, but for 2 decades, I've suffered through utter craziness on my street. This year - going to a hotel. It's pathetic."
"113","Jeff Myrtle","Sadly, I don't know what can be done through law enforcement. It's too much. On the 4th and New Years Eve, the east side is essentially under siege. For those of us with dogs, it's particularly evident. What's worked for me is to give him a treat when there's an explosion. I also close up the house and turn the fan on to drown out the sound. Seems to mellow him a bit."
"113","Dana S.","If it was enforced/cited for the nearly full month they go off prior to the 4th, when things are a little quieter, it might discourage at least a few people from doing it again and maybe relieve some of the madness on the 4th.  But even prior to the 4th, LAPD said they will not enforce it.  O'Farrell's office, knowing that it won't be enforced either way, emailed residents an SMS number to use to report fireworks, which, depending on which number on that email that you use, either sends you to the Boston PD or just tells you to call the 877 number to report instead.  The LAPD lead officer for our area said they've been directed to ignore the fireworks, so it's going to take either asking City Council to request LAPD enforce it, or god forbid, a tragedy and a lawsuit, before anything changes.  We give our dogs xanax, thundershirts, and put on music, but they still shake so badly that we can't leave the house.  We left during the afternoon yesterday and one of them nearly tore the door down trying to escape.  Can't imagine how awful this must be for vets."
"113","Madolin W.","In all the years I lived in the SF Bay Area, there were two nights a year I dreaded because our pets would get so distraught: New Year’s Eve and July 4th. (Not to say my own nervous system wasn’t jangled, that too.) Our high-strung dog hid under the bed or shook and chattered in the bathtub, and was once triggered by the noise into an epileptic seizure. One year our cat ran away into hiding, missing for two weeks before I found him - dehydrated, filthy, starving, shivering, terrified. I had no idea before moving into this neighborhood that it would go on randomly and intermittently throughout the year and then for a solid month and a half in the summer. Gunshots, gunpowder, firecrackers, and fireworks blend together in an undifferentiated cacophony of sounds, smells, and noise that might actually be evidence of violent crime happening, not just “fun.”

Watching spectacular light displays in the night sky from a safe distance and high vantage point that can be enjoyed with lots of other people is something entirely different than what is happening here in our neighborhood. 

My cat has again been exhibiting PTSD-symptomatic behavior. The neighbors directly behind us (with several small children) have been going at it the last several days. One of their fireworks late last night was so powerful it shook the house and felt like a massive bomb had exploded in our backyard. Considering the gang warfare in various parts of the city, and how dramatically worldwide terrorist attacks have increased, the persistent popularity of this activity that mimics terrorism is hard to understand."

They have killed my animals, driven me to distraction ad dont care if i go to jail or have a heart attack."
"113","Dana S.","The LAFD captain for our district said that there were 5 fatalities in our district alone last Fourth of July, and they have no fire engine for the district.  (Just spoke w him bc I wanted to see how to use a fire escape ladder in my daughter's room without a window sill).  They are also low on resources and staff and said last year they were at one fire when a call came in for a second fire in the district, and they couldn't even go to the second fire.  I can't even park an inch over my driveway apron without being immediately cited.  The idea that the city puts zero resources into citing fireworks in a brush fire zone is insane.  The captain was very helpful and he suggested getting a group together to petition the city council to purchase them an engine, so at least they'd have resources to fight the fires."

"118","Alexander Barber","Laura, I take it Southeast Hollywood South doesn't have permit parking either then?  I have to park like an ass more often than I would care to admit, on curbs, etc..  It wouldn't be half this bad if parking enforcement weren't so focused on generating revenue for the city.  

I asked council member O'Farrell's deputy how much of the city's annual budget comes from parking tickets - apparently somewhere around 100-200 million dollars of it.

Which is the only way I can make sense of having to park in a metered space and oversleeping to find not one but THREE parking citations, all in excess of $60 and for the same thing, on my windshield the following morning.  

As an unemployed college student, I could scarcely afford to pay one of those right now, let alone three.  Yet the review and appeals process is completely internalized and secretive, and therefore existing in a near constant state of conflicting interest..

Parking and traffic enforcement are effectively the most harmful to those with the least to lose, since the appeals process is essentially hopeless, and the city will seize and auction your car without permission or adequate due process of law if you have five of them outstanding (unpaid).  Five parking tickets can accumulate in the blink of an eye, as evidenced by my observation that LADOT parking enforcement thinks nothing of writing three tickets for one offense. 

It would seem that the only escape from this damaging status quo, the best and only clear option for car-owning working class angelenos to protect ourselves would be to expand existing permit parking districts to more rental-dominated and garage-deficient downtown neighborhoods, where parking is ALWAYS in short supply."
"118","Laura K.","It's totally a scam. I pay $32 a year for a 46 Parking permit. I live on Edgemont.  Where Edgemont crosses Council is where you need a parking permit. Yet it goes all the way down to 1st Street on most other streets.  Now...I have my sticker and I have to walk forever to get home....yet somehow I got a ticket about three weeks ago for not having a permit? (SMH) It's clearly visible.  So I had to take time out of MY work day to go and fight it.  If it was not for their own records saying I had a permit they would have totally made me pay for that invalid ticket.  And more more thing to boot it all off....when I went to get my parking permit, they would not find our street.  Took them five weeks to send someone over to say .... yeap there is Edgemont. I can't take it anymore. Currently looking to move."
"118","Alexander Barber","I always take the metro when I can, but there are a lot of places that are still totally inaccessible via Metro rail, so it remains impractical for me to sell my car since I have friends and activities in areas without rail service (for instance Malibu, Calabasas, Belmont Shore etc..) 

You know what really stings? When I manage to avoid driving for a day or two and while walking home from the Metro station, noticing that some parking enforcement officer has decided to enforce the stupid 2 hour parking limit in front of my building and given me a ticket,  completely wiping out any money I might have saved by taking the train. 

There are ticket lawyers too, but upon consulting with some of them it became pretty clear that they are not interested in anything less than several hundred dollar plus speeding tickets.  Hiring an attorney for a parking ticket, even several of them, will nearly always cost more than the tickets themselves.

The best way I've found to deal with parking tickets, and in fact the ONLY way with which I have had ANY success whatsoever:

     1.) Contest the ticket with LADOT or the issuing agency.  You can put time and energy into your appeal if you feel so inspired, but in my experience it is not worth the effort.  You will always lose the appeal due to the inherent conflicts of interest in the appeals process, but filing one will buy you some time before they are allowed to impound your car or send the ticket to collections and screw up your credit. 

     2.) Call in and schedule a meeting with somebody in your city council member's office (in person, they likely won't do anything otherwise), and bring copies of the ticket(s) and any photographs or other documentation you have compiled supporting your claim that the ticket was issued in error or unlawfully.  

     City Council Members will not always be able to fix stuff, but their constituent services staff generally know the inner workings of LADOT and other city bureaucracies well enough to have the contacts necessary to get your case through the bureaucracy and provide solutions, as long as you can persuade them that you are in the right and that the ticket is unfair."

Considering the massive scale of plate tectonic movement though I doubt that the two faults are not connected so I'm still a little nervous. 

The San Andreas fault needs to move 16 feet at some point, based the pacific plate's relative movement in the past century. 

Every decade that the San Andreas fault is silent - that distance increases by about 1.6 feet, and therefore so does the size of the earthquake for which we are long overdue.  

The last time San Andreas REALLY woke up in the 1800s Los Angeles was still a dusty little cowtown without any notable infrastructure and the population of a little village, but the massive 7.9 was felt hundreds of miles away."

This is probably the type of post more appropriate on your Facebook feed, which is filtered by those we are friends with and those we don't know. Writing about issues in the neighborhood, the fact that there is an election, and how a candidate (likely a neighborhood council candidate, not a statewide candidate) can affect said issues might be useful information to your neighbors, but a list of those candidates you ""endorse"" does not belong here. Unfortunately, you can see from the comments that your intended educational information has turned into a partisan commentary pitting neighbor against neighbor. I support the general rule of avoiding such topics as religion and politics with those that you don't have a personal relationship. Let's keep this forum positive, polite and focused on our neighborhood."
"124","Jennifer Daley","Thanks for putting in so much time researching this, Alexander! I'm an activist and avid supporter of education, so I appreciate you sharing the info. Many people in our neighborhoods are active members of society and the political process, and are coming together for the greater good. Other people that don't want to be involved in that way on Next Door can simply stop reading and move on to the next post. Easy! Thanks again."
"124","Alexander Barber","I'm sorry that you and Barbara feel that way, Cheryl. I think that avoiding political debate on a neighborhood forum such as this would be a shameful waste of an opportunity to increase civic engagement and awareness of local political elections which, like I said, affect us all whether we like it or not. 

To use Nextdoor only to complain about problems facing our respective neighborhoods, and not discussing the political environment from which those problems emerged would seem to me an effort in futility and a waste of time. 

Nextdoor is great for tracking down lost pets, finding homes for strays, and notifying neighbors of criminal mishaps in our respective areas. To be content with mere awareness of these problems without any thought paid to WHY exactly certain problems exist, and HOW our elected representatives should attempt to address them is, quite earnestly, intellectually dishonest, and counterproductive. 

I can post my opinions on facebook until I have carpal tunnel, but on facebook, you are only generally able to 'preach to the choir' so to speak - meaning engaging with only those who already share one's views. 

I am wholly disinterested in being agreed with for the sake of ego or otherwise. I am interested rather only in civil discourse and thoughtful debate resulting in the productive and amicable discovery of intelligent and fair solutions to local problems. 

Just as I stated to Barbara, I think a more reasonable response to my posting a political opinion here would be to post a differing opinion piece, perhaps with an explanation of what lead you to come to such a differing conclusion on the matter. 

The contribution of somebody with a differing opinion on the matter I first wrote about would result in those previously unengaged in local politics who chanced upon this forum to have access to multiple contrasting viewpoints, and therefore having the option to decide fairly for themselves which opinion better suits them. 

The suppression of such political discourse on this forum, which is what yourself and Barbara are quite clearly suggesting, would be against the spirit of democracy, actively discouraging the participation of previously unengaged citizens from joining in dialogues that can and will affect all of us in one way or another. 

It can affect us both positively, or negatively, and if we choose to participate in the democratic process, then we can steer the discourse in such a way as to ensure the continuing health and safety of our communities. 

But to instead take a stance of apathy and deliberate ignorance is not fair to our neighbors, our friends, or our children - as they will be affected by the politics of our city in the future, just as we will be too. 

Whenever I have children, and I do intend to do so at some point, I refuse to put myself in a position today where I must explain to my children in some years that I HAD A CHANCE to make our city better, to work with my friends and neighbors to participate and contribute towards the discovery and implementation of effective solutions to our big city with big problems, but I gave up and shoveled the problems we face now onto their generation.

The next generation of innocent children who will have had no role in the creation of the injustices and political ignorance that may affect them would be stunted and oppressed by those same problems we failed to address, and they would struggle to succeed against great odds, merely because some people didn't want to hear about it.

That just doesn't feel right to me, and it should feel right to anybody else, either."

"124","Dennis Levin","My recommendations for the June 7th Elections:

VOTE !"
"124","Alexander Barber","Yes!  Fun fact, Dennis; California has processed 1.5 Million new voter registrations (many of them being new citizens and young people recently coming of voting age) since January, so turnout is expected to be considerably above average for this election! :)"
"124","Picasso Wife","My response was flagged too :-("
"124","Alexander Barber","Picasso, take it as a compliment! The way I look at it, if one says something that doesn't ruffle any feathers, it is probably not worth saying. 🙃

Oh yes, Sally - I am sure of it!"
"124","Dennis Levin","Alexander, AND if you can piss off both sides, then you probably have it right."
"124","Barbara James","Does anyone remember the 2000 election? I sure do. Ralph Nader, Al Gore, bush? Ralph helped split the liberal vote and I worry about that for this election. Different isn't always better. The president has to work with Congress, compromises need to be made. Make a statement in the primary's but please think carefully when the presidential election happens."
"124","Barbara James","And I am grateful to see him pushing democrats to the left."
"124","Barbara James","Thanks! I'm enjoying the discussion :)"
"124","Barbara James","I know, but I'm the Barbara who wrote about never Trump, so I'm totally invested in this conversation."
"124","Jill James","Hi folks - for those of you who are registered as No Party Preference (NPP) independents and and want to cast a presidential primary vote, you need to take special steps ASAP. If you'd like to vote for a Democratic, Libertarian, or American Independent Party candidate, you must request one party's ballot BY MAY 31 or take special steps at your polling place. If you want to vote Republican, Green, or Peace and Freedom Party, you must RE-REGISTER TO VOTE BY MAY 23.

You may also be subject to special submission procedures. In other words, don't assume you'll get the ballot you want at your polling place.

Here's the CA Secretary of State page with full, current information: http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/political-parties/no-party-preference/"
"124","Picasso Wife","I hear what you are saying Barbara. But, Nader did not prevent Gore from winning. Gore won! Remember, once all the ballots were counted, he had the winning vote? Only, Florida appointed W. President before the votes could all be counted.

And this is extortion, this 2 Party system. More vibrant Democracies have many parties. When there are only 2, elections are just a Plutocratic formality dressed up as Democracy. You've seen pictures of the Clintons with Trump. They are all sitting at the same gluttonous table. Time for a Revolution!"
"124","Carol Cetrone","Thank you Alexander for your extensive research and your thoughtful posts; and to Don Durkee for keeping it real...  I do understand how people can get defensive about their privacy and the very personal nature of their vote.  Barbara is one of those who takes her vote very seriously, does her own private research and takes offense at anyone ""helping"".  But seriously Barbara, there are many, many people who do no research at all, which is frightening.  Alexander's post is meant to educate, not dictate.  He was very clear about his methods and points of view, so you can easily see if he's in your camp or not.  I usually do the same excruciating research (those judges..!!) and send it out to a bunch of friends who are always very appreciative.  In fact, if I don't send it early enough I get prodded.  But I do have friends who have asked me to remove them, which is never a problem.  It's good information from a caring citizen - way better info than on those glossy posters that are purchased by lobbyists and clogging up our mailboxes...  The sad part is that they work; so many people are sheep."
"124","Teresa Williams","No Party Preference is NOT the same as the Independent Party. You can vote in this primary if you are NPP but not if you are Independent Party. If you want to switch you must do so before the 23rd. Voting by mail is encouraged so that you don't wind up in some sort of voting scandal (see Kentucky and others). Yes this is confusing and our voting system needs to be simplified and streamlined.    As far as this conversation goes-it should stay up. My God, freedom of speech and all that!"
"124","Alexander Barber","Teresa, Sally - you weren't kidding. The AIP is the nation's most popular party amongst those who don't know what party they're in:  http://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474725586/many-american-independent-party-voters-in-california-are-mis-registered"
"124","Natalie Epstein","Hi Alex, 
I didn't see your choice for County - Mark Ridley Thomas or Jackie Lacey? Also didn't see your choice for party county committee. Any recommendations?  Thanks"
"124","Alexander Barber","Hey Natalie, yeah they're both running unopposed but I like both Jackie Lacey and Mark Ridley-Thomas. 

I didn't have as much time to look into PCC nominees but the website LA progressive endorsed the following four: Wade M. L. Kyle and Uduak-Joe Ntuk for the 70th Assembly District. The LA Progressive also endorses Dallas Fowler and Gail Burns."
"124","Natalie Epstein","Sorry Alex, I meant 53rd assembly district. Also disregard my question re:county. Jackie Lacey is running for district attorney and Ridley - Thomas is running for Supervisor 2nd district - both are running for reelection and there are no challengers. Would like to know your choice for 53rd Assembly - says you can vote for up to 7, there are 12 to choose from and they are all democrat. Thanks"
"124","Natalie Epstein","Thanks Alex!"
"124","Teresa Williams","VERY IMPORTANT about the vote: For US Senator the sample ballot has two pages of candidates. Your are only allowed ONE selection amongst the 34 candidates. While this may seem obvious, be careful in marking your ballot. Should you choose two candidates by accident, your WHOLE BALLOT will be thrown out. 

If you are NPP (No Party Preference) and want to vote democrat (go Bernie!), ask for a CROSSOVER ballot, not provisional. Your provisional vote may not be counted. If you are voting for Hillary, go ahead and vote provisional (that's a joke people). 

Also I tried to find info on the Party County Committee candidates but it was very challenging. I did find this involving Karina Macias and it sure doesn't look good: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWDJ-UZNpkM

So all I got is don't vote for her!"

"124","Laura K.","Glad to see many are participating in the conversation. I just want you to get to the polls. I voted, did you?"
"124","Celina Reyes","Voted and it was super easy. Thank goodness."
"124","Teresa Williams","Voted and had an insane conversation with the polling woman about how all the votes are considered provisional and that at the end of the day they are all (regular ballots, vote-
by-mail delivered to polling place, provisional) thrown into the same box and sent to a counting office (not Norwalk). I'm exhausted of the inconsistencies of information on the voting process. :/"
"124","Alexander Barber","I feel the same, Teresa.  It really baffles me that the voting process, mechanically speaking (it has improved a lot in terms of who is allowed to do it) has not been improved even marginally since our country was founded.

We need to transition to a blockchain government, which would store all government data on a decentralized computer network completely visible to everybody (I will get into that further at a later time, though.)

As Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis famously stated back in 1913, ""Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.""

With (or even without) that famous statement in mind, from the electoral college to super delegates, felon disenfranchisement, closed primaries, and voter ID laws, it is markedly difficult to justify the extent to which the very mechanics of our democratic process continue to be so deliberately obfuscating, secretive and problematically undemocratic."
"124","Alexander Barber","Laura, I mailed in my ballot weeks ago :)"
"124","Alexander Barber","Oh I didn't forget about them.  If you ask me, political parties should be either be eliminated altogether, or at least the republican/democrat duopoly should be abolished.  

The primary nomination process ought to look a lot less like American Idol and a lot more like reddit."
"124","Alexander Barber","Sally, as if there weren't enough reasons to love Elizabeth Warren already: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/04/elizabeth-warren-superdelegates-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton"
"124","Alexander Barber","That was something Donald Trump brought up, in addition to sicking his army of undereducated bigots on her for her partial Native American heritage.

I don't really see the hypocrisy there myself, the real hypocrites I see here are the folks over at the national review failing to hold the systemically fraudulent banking industry accountable for the 2008 housing crisis - choosing instead to join unwatered chia pet and obvious racist Donald Trump in attacking one of the few elected representatives we have who is actually trying to prevent it from happening again.  

Would you personally pass on a great deal for a house because it had been foreclosed, Sally?  I don't think most people would."

"148","Matt Stauffer","LA needs more housing, period. I absolutely welcome this development."
"148","Justine Arauz","Most of these developments are driving out the culture of our city and taking out the character of our neighborhood, I was born and raised most of my life in Koreantown and it saddened me to see these developers lack of consideration or culture awareness because they don't live here, I hate to see alot of people I call neighbors disappear"
"148","Regina Jones","Los Angeles needs more housing but the development of that housing should be done with integrity and oversight.  At the same time a portion of all new development over a certain size should be made available to low and fixed-income residents."
"148","Matt Stauffer","Many of the old buildings that give this neighborhood so much character could never be built today because the zoning is so restrictive. People wouldn't allow something like the Gaylord--14 stories with no parking. Los Angeles is shifting away from the car and we need to allow developers to build to that. Parking is an expensive amenity that we require them to provide, and it drives up the cost of housing for everyone.

There are lots of other restrictions that we need to rethink. When we tell a builder, ""Okay, you can build here, but you can't build above this height, you have to have a setback (front yard) at least this big, you have to provide X number of parking spaces, you have to have an elevator lobby on every floor,"" we get a bunch of uninspired buildings that all look the same. And because all of those restrictions cost the builder money, the only way they can make it back is by making the units luxury.

I'm afraid that my landlord will eventually decide our rent controlled building no longer makes financial sense, and will sell to a developer who will tear it down and build luxury condos. And when that time comes, I won't be able to stay in Koreatown because there are no vacancies because people stood in the way of projects like this. Every new unit we build, even if it's luxury, pushes that day back.

Regina, I think your idea about requiring projects of a certain size to include affordable units has some merit. The state has a law on the books already, SB 1818, that requires developers be given a ""density"" bonus for including those (e.g., if you build this many low-income units, you can build this much taller). But in my experience, neighborhoods hate that law because they hate density in general, due to fears over traffic and parking, mostly."
"148","Ter Hash","Parking for apartments are expensive but a necessity. 
I have people who park in front of my home and walk down the block or around the corner to their homes/apts and/or leave their cars parked until it's time to move them on street sweeping days. My guests and I can't even park in front of my own home."
"148","Matt Stauffer","It's inconvenient to walk a couple blocks, but that's life in the big city. Parking is no more a necessity than a gym or a pool, and at a time when we are about 30 years behind where we should be in terms of housing construction, we can't afford to build housing for cars to the exclusion of housing for people."
"148","Ter Hash","@ Matt do you and your guests have trouble parking in front of your own home?"
"148","Ben Loescher","The so-called Neighorhood Integrity Initiative fails to recognize that maintaining the status quo isn't an option unless we want Los Angeles to become like Manhattan, where only the very wealthy can live here.  Growth is inevitable - neighborhood groups should stop focusing on trying to stop growth, and start working to ensure that we have the transit, parks and schools to support it when it happens."
"148","Matt Stauffer","Yes and no. Street parking in Koreatown is scarce, but I knew that coming in, so I found a place that had an on-site parking space (more on that later*). If I know I have a guest coming over, I take my car out and circle around to find a spot on the street, and let my guest have my on-site space. At worst, I'll drive three blocks up toward Wilshire and park at the meters. But I also don't feel any special right to park on the street in front of my building. There are 50 units in my apartment building and we can't all park in front.

Now, you might say, ""Well, what if you have more than one guest?"" And I would counter by asking how many parking spaces do you think each home should have? What if I want to host a Super Bowl party with 30 of my closest friends? Should a developer be required to provide 30 spaces per residence, just in case of that eventuality? I don't think many of us would agree.

Now my question to you is, does your home have on-site parking?  Why are you and your guests parking in front instead of in your driveway, garage, or lot?

Developers are in business to make money, and they know their market. If they think their customers/tenants/homeowners want parking, they'll build it. They don't need the city to tell them to. But if they don't--maybe they specialize in affordable housing, or senior housing--the city won't let them ""by right"" forgo the parking requirements. They have to request a variance which may or may not be granted, and if it is, people get up in arms because the city is granting ""favors"" and not following the zoning code.

*To follow up on my earlier point about my on-site parking: My building was constructed in 1928. It sits next to an identically sized parcel which houses our parking lot. At some point in time, there was a building on that parcel that was torn down to accommodate car parking for our building. It's large enough for 34 cars. So in order to house 34 cars, the city lost 50 units of housing (assuming an identical building). That may have made sense in the past, when Los Angeles was less populous and more car-crazy. But times have changed and I think we need our zoning to reflect that."
"148","Ter Hash","@Matt, I do have a driveway and when I expect guests for holiday dinners, etc. I will park down the street if I can find a spot, so my elderly family members can park in my driveway.  
I have no problem with development, and despite all the improvements in our public transit system, LA is still car centric. But when I can't find parking on the street where I live and people from blocks away leave their car parked for a week is a pet peeve of mine. And call me old school but it used to be that when you needed to park your own car on the street, you park in front of your own home, not your neighbors or in front of someone else's house around the block and leave it there for days. 
I'm not trying to argue or debate with you about this...just expressing my opinion and my own trouble with parking. 
Have a nice day, sincerely."
"148","Rosie Rodriguez","Ive had an issue with parking since I moved in to my home with people blocking my driveway.  Ive had to resort to leaving a car in front of my home to avoid being blocked in. I've had neighbors come to my home an argue when I have called parking enforcement due to not being able to get out. I think our area should be blocked off  from non residents.  Ive had people from apartment buildings park in front of my home and leave their trash and other questionable stuff on my lawn or front steps of my gate."
"148","David Takehara","I hope DOT towed the car. I have had that problem too."
"148","Richard Gellis","I propose this solution, it would be a boon to the city and alleviate the traffic problem and much pollution.  If upon registering a vehicle it would be a requirement to show that there was parking provided for that said vehicle or pay $1500 per year to support the building of underground parking for the public who inhabit an apartment or condominium that does not proved parking for all of the housing units cars. thus is you had an apartment and your family had 3 cars your would be required to show 3 reserved parking spaces, if not the levy on the cars not provided would be invoked.  This would have a profound effect on our crowded roadways and streets, and promote energy efficiency and public transportation, if you want the luxury of driving your own vehicle it would be but a smell amount to pay and included in the registration fee. It is a requirement for a single family home to have a garage or carport to house the families cars, it is a requirement that a homeowner deed over the sidewalk and parkway land to the city, and to keep up the basic maintenance as well.  Could it be construed that there is also an entitlement to be able to park in front of an owned or rented single family or duplex or 4 family home?  Well lets look at that, most single lots in this city are approximately 50 feet wide, a 10 or 12 foot driveway could still accommodate two automobiles on the street and three if the driveway slope were blocked by the inhabitants, so right there 2 required off street ! covered, and three more right in front. is that too much to ask for? is the idea of dense population, housed in rabbit warrens and mazes, would also be taxed for taking up the streets and roadways, beyond the gasoline tax?  Is there any benefit of living in a single family home?  Is this a commonwealth state? I have so many questions, feel free  to rebut.  thank you for you attention to detail in advance. 

p.s.  I remember from my childhood in New York that my dad had a parking garage space for his new 49 Mercury, it was the only way to keep the car safe and not worry about the street cleaning, and it was a courtesy to the neighborhood where his father, a tailor, {in those days it was common to own your own machine and be employed to use it at a company site, it was a step above the sweat shops, a way for the everyday man with some drive and smarts to be able to get ahead}. to be able with the help of his sons work contributions to purchase a 4 family house, to be a landlord, to have the responsibility of upkeep, paying for the fuel oil, making sure that the tenants had their requirements of life available. To directly support the banks and the economy of our nation.  There were two tenants, My mom & dad inhabited the large upper flat, my grandparents the lover large one, and even at 8 years old I was given the combination to the corral in the basement to manually fill the boiler when awaiting a part for the automatic water feed.  I had a responsibility early on and that is fine with me I have remained responsible in my life.  I really don't want to park in front of someone elses home, it is notable that one of the dwellers in a 4 family house on my block bids his little boy to go out in the street and put broken glass before and after the tires of anyone who parks in front of their apartment. I know, I had a guest that parked there later on mentioned it, now really. Another question it mirthful to have sprinklers that face the street turn on automatically and douse the cars parked in front of a dwelling, oh what fun, not. Ah yes, where is that American Dream, Where is the leisure time that was so abundant in the '60's.  Now there is another keg of worms, and that, in this day is a compressed mass of super concentration.  More fodder for the therapists to address. Another kid shooting up his school out of entitlement. and of course the big cash prizes and presents awarded to kids for tying their own shoes, each and every time, your a brilliant one you are better than the rest, rest assured.  Oh yes, the lottery is a fine thing, winner winner, chicken dinner. -30-

P.S., P. S., Now the sons and daughters come home to roost, I like that concept, the nuclear family, not the separation of the monster cities. The human way of living.  Some call this dysfunctional, well, it depends on the point of view, independence is a good thing and being in the bosom of ur families is another virtue.  This old man comes rolling home."
"148","Richard Gellis","I will edit when I have a chance, so it is, indeed through the idea, not a perfectly spelled and intoxicatingly sinful execution of butchered syntax. I have voiced my stilted opinions, dither, dither, either or.  Fiddle faddle blabber bosh, humbuck, poppycock hand the rest are here on Giulligans Isle. I have a soft spot for Dr. Demento."
"148","Raymond Primrose","Read into this a bit closer. This is a Korean project and when it's all done they are going to push it to their own people first. What you people haven't seen the rapid and slick way the Koreans are slipping through the circle, building and buying up property and raising up the rent to force people out? When they built the WiSpa on Wilshire & Rampart that was the wake up call for me."
"148","Judy Reidel","Please don't blame the Koreans or any other nationality.  It is anyone's money plus politics in a global investment world.  Make sure you vote.  It's what it means to be a citizen.  Australia requires everyone to vote I think I heard."
"148","Raymond Primrose","Judy you can't speak on what's going on in my neighborhood and what the Koreans are doing. Lady you live in a far away district and a closed community catering to a bunch of whites. You know nothing of the Westlake & Rampart situation."
"148","Patrick Lee","Wow."
"148","Amy Vuckovich","Raymond sounds like he could use a relaxing spa treatment from the Wi Spa.
And truly , we are all living the lie of our city ""asking for help"" to identify important architecture ,preserve out culture and yet the same seem perfectly Ok with taking developer money and creating eyesores,traffic jams, and apartments designed on paper with the designer never even seeing the egress, or where tenants would gain light from windows. yuck"
"148","Raymond Primrose","Amy Fuckovich no thanks. My woman gives me a spa treatment unlike any other."
"148","Saira Martinez","This forum is for neighbors to express concerns, share ideas, events, and perhaps find solutions. It should not be tainted by the misplaced anger, biases, or prejudices that we might harbor."
"148","Richard Bourne","Sounds like a lot of whining to me.  Complaints about parking, yet any new development will come with an underground garage for all the residents.  
Complaints about traffic, yet traffic is actually better in Koreatown than most of LA.
Complaints about the 'character' of the neighborhood but no mention of where this tower would stand.  There are already several 30 story buildings in Koreatown.  

I'm not in favor of throwing zoning restrictions to the wind whenever any big developer waves some cash, but those zoning restrictions we currently have are more suited to 1970 than today.  We need to reform them so everyone can develop at a modest pace updating the housing stock and increasing density.  I would be in favor of an artistic review board for zoning exceptions. That or give beau arts and art decco buildings an extra story or less setback requirements."
"148","Justine Arauz","I think koreatown is mixture of both single family homes and apartments, and every block varies where we may see the wilshire area more of an apartment base, south of Olympic has a mix homes and 2 story apartments and country club has a majority of homes, so we all have different opions on the subject because we looking at it from our point of living, we shouldn't point the finger towards individuals but we should be more involved in our neighborhood counsel meetings and voice our concerns, and as a group we can share opinions and since it's your neighborhood you can help shape it"
"148","Richard Bourne","The project in question would be on the land of 805-823 S Catalina St.  This is a little further off Wilshire than I would have expected.  Between 6th and 7th street this project would not seem out of place at all.  So it seems a block and a half out of place.  

Still, that section of street is all apartments, except for 1 property that appears to be 2 trailers in a bungalow court.  Many of the apartments are 4 stories tall and none of them are particularly attractive.  Across the street from it is an ugly motel and next to it is that lovely liquor store on 8th.  

The building would be in my viewshed and I bet it will be ugly.  Still I am not opposed to it just on that."
"148","Ann Brooks","Survey LA (Cty's historic survey) found none of those buildings historic & they're not in a CRA historic survey area. I do know someone who nominated a beautiful French Normandie 6 unit apt building  in that section that is now a monument."
"148","Rosie Rodriguez","When I bought my home my must haves wgere to be close to my husband mom due to illness. I wanted to be close in case of an emergency.  The area was much different then. I loved the character and astetic of the homes in the area. With that said the area has changed. I feel that there's  an overcrowding of restaurants that dont provide ample parking and that the apartment buildings around Western and Manhattan dont try to keep the sidewalks clean and people sometimes are doing auto mecanic work out on the street. I think apartment owners should have strict rules with tenants regarding disposal of items and what can be done on sidewalks surrounding the building also. I  have wanted to ask regarding fencing in the area to blook undesirable traffic through St. Andrews I dont feel comfortable in letting my son bike around our area due to cars driving like their on the freeway. I even had people honk at me when I'm trying to get in to my driveway. Lol"

"153","Mark M.","An awesome opportunity for sure.  Considering this is a volunteer activity, however, the $350 price tag will make the course all but unaffordable to the majority of CERT members I know in Northeast LA.  Maybe someday there will be a payment plan option or even better, a grant paying our tuition!  Cheers, Mark"
"153","Battalion Fifteen Coordinator","Level 2 classes are offered by the American Red Cross; they deal with Shelter Operations and processes.

You must begin with Level 1, but you can take Level 3 before Level 2.

Level 3 classes concentrate on high-level medical knowledge and training.  Current events are such that this will be the last year that the ARC offers the Level 3 classes (known as EMR or Emergency Medical Responder).  The instructors are cross-trained from ARC and the National Safety Council so this course is an NSC certificated class.

If you cannot make this particular class for reasons mentioned above please consider contacting the instructor as she has a tremendous network of contacts related to classes and opportunities related to this subject matter.  Her email is in the flyer in the original post.

Also, please note that Level 2 and/or Level 3 are optional and up to the CERT volunteer for continuing education."

I have one discharged, one too old, and when I went looking for a place to service them all I could find were for office systems.  I don't need a system, just two extinguishers recharged."

I didn't pay for my level one training either time, as a matter of fact they paid the national guard personnel to show up at my first training at the armory in Van Nuys. 
THE COST IS UNREASONABLE ! Where's the federal/state funding for something like this. If they're willing to pay the nat'l guard then obviosly there is money to cover the average Joes' who just want to help."

"153","Dan T.","This EMR Class isn't an LAFD CERT class. It is independently taught but does meet the requirements for LAFD CERT Level 3. The class is taught where there are enough people interested in taking it. In this case, it's Agoura Hills / Malibu folks that arranged it. I'm sure the instructors would be happy to teach it elsewhere should there be enough interest. Between the cost of books, materials, and certificates and the intense 60+ hours it takes to complete the course, it has often been difficult to get enough people to make up a class."
"153","Alan G.","i am certified and sure would like others. what if it is me that needs aid ?? I sure would want someone trained. I highly doubt it is promoting anything but community safety.  Lets see how many dedicated people will put in the 64 hours of training and pay the $350.00 fee plus the $80.00 book. In the end Hugo may be right.

This is becoming a serious problem, and may well, and probably should, wind-up in the court system, invalidating  NC election results and costing the tax payer a LOT of wasted money. I'm STILL waiting to hear from the so-called ""powers that be."""
"170","Robert B.","Yes, we must adhere to all of the ""basic ethical guidelines"" as in any other public election. So what is your complaint?

No one in city hall cares.  They do whatever they want.   They have no regard to what the public cares about.   This survey is just pretend we care about you.   It is so fake."
"170","Susan R.","Neighborhood councils that do not work or do anything for the community should be shut down.     Take away the NC budget and give it to the city councilmember's discretionary fund to be used for the neighborhood.   The neighborhood council has just become a money funded machine.   Many neighborhood councils just use the NC for sending money to their favorite functions.   That was not suppose to be the purpose of the neighborhood council.    

The purpose of the neighborhood council was to be a VOICE to city hall.   Many neighborhood council's have no voice to city hall.    Stop funding neighborhood councils.    A lot more work would get done instead of wasting time just giving away money."

"175","Claire G.","Try not to open the fridge or freezer unless absolutely necessary. If you need to make a dish, list what you need beforehand then take it all out so you only open one time to take out and put back."
"175","Kathleen O.","If you lose your power, contact Jon at Fresco Market.  He offered to let me use his freezer when we had the horrid windstorm about 3 or 4 years ago and the whole area lost power for 3 days."
"175","Alysoun H.","Those will help.  You can also use milk jugs that have been cleaned and replaced with water.  Basically it's a big ice pack that can be used as a water source if needed.  Freezers are most efficient if they are full (the frozen items help maintain the cold temperature) so I fill in any gaps with the milk jugs and smaller plastic juice bottles filled with water.  If the power goes out the ice jugs will help keep things cold.  Also, Claire's suggestion of not opening the door will make a big difference.  Of course if power is out for a number of days..."
"175","Sylvie C.","Just get some can food, fruit and power bars or crackers ,lots of water and  you can live on that for as week, plus little diet never hurts anyone.
You don't need a fridge."
"175","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","I have plenty of those, but I also have a freezer full of food that I don't want to go bad."
"175","DS S.","Filling space in your freezer or refrigerator empty boxes helps, too. This prevents cold air from escaping when the door is opened. Air trapped in the container will not need to be refrigerated again. Alysoun's suggestion of water containers will maintain temperature over a longer period of time. Newer Energy Star refrigerators run almost continuously at a lower wattage (energy consumption) allowing a smaller generator to be utilized (for 22 cu ft, about 1/2 amperage with one made 20 years ago)."
"175","Perry P.","When you get ice put it in baggies and wrap them in plastic bags like the 99 bags and your ice will last at least a day in the ice chest I know because we go on trips and it works you can practice now and you will notice the longevity of the coldness"
"175","Bt Timmerman","modern refrigerators have excellent insulation and as long as you don't open the door a lot or for long periods, you should be fine for as long as you would normally keep food (i'm talking days, not weeks). Think a big Igloo Ice chest with much better insulation! Again, only open the door when you know what you want, open it wide enough just to remove the item and close it quickly. A chest type freezer or refrigerator will hold it's temperature even longer because the cold air doesn't ""spill"" out the front door."
"175","Tal A.","Specifically, cold air is denser than warm air, therefore heavier, therefore cold air sinks - that's why chest type freezers are more efficient. 

(It's also why ceiling fans are reversible, and can be run backwards in the winter to warm rooms up...)"
"175","Cynthia Delgado","The suggestion I have read about is to use the fridge food first and even if you have to invite neighbors for a meal, then move on to frozen food doing the same, then shelf food last...🤔"
"175","Christopher H.","Also, move your refrigerator food that will spoil faster (eggs, milk, etc) into the freezer to make them last longer.  The freezer has more insulation than the refrigerator compartment and the already frozen food will keep it colder longer."
"175","DS S.","""invite neighbors for a meal,""  That's the best idea yet!"
"175","Jamie R.","another way to get hold of freezer thingies is to order chocolate online.  lindt, godiva, something like that.  they package it with a bunch of freezer packs.  and then you have some chocolate, too.  ;)  i've always kept mine in the freezer, b/c i have the space and figured, why throw them out?  but it didn't occur to me that they're helping me in a power outage.  cool!"
"175","Lars Theriot","I keep several gallon bottles of water frozen in my freezer. Whenever the power goes out I move the frozen bottles over to the fridge where they keep the temp down for longer than it would stay down left to its own devices. Plus when they melt I have clean drinking water should there be an unsafe water alert along with the loss of power."
"175","Lars Theriot","In lieu of a generator, you can buy a cheap inverter and put it on your car battery. Sitting at idle the car with inverter can power your fridge and devices for as long as the gas holds out. You can run the fridge for a couple hours just to get it cold again then shut it off. Couple five gallon gas cans in the garage with stabil in them and you should be able to weather just about anything short of the zombie apocalypse"
"175","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","Also A portable power supply may work if your vehicle is not conveniently located near your residence."
"175","Brian F.","I have to question that ""Portable Power Supply"" in context to keeping a refrigerator running. It won't."
"175","Brian F.","As to the Freez-R-Bricks shown by the original poster, not sure what your intention is with those either. I am not sure if your refrigerator would stay colder longer with or without those inside when the power went out. 
There are lots of reference sources as to how to handle your refrigerated food in a power failure. Most important is don't open the fridge/freezer unless you have to and then if you sense power is going to be out for some time, what to use/cook first if possible etc.
But just having some picnic cooler ice packs in your freezer, not sure if beneficial or not.

Thanks"
"175","Lars Theriot","I think you can get 50 foot cables. You need to get the big thick heavy gauge cables, electricity bleeds off over distance traveled and the big thick cables are designed to lose the least amount of power over the 50 feet. They're a little expensive but still cheaper than a generator. Here's a good link on how to build a mobile and stationary battery bank that runs off your car battery  http://www.battery1234.com/"
"175","Lars Theriot","if anyone is looking for a good preparedness podcast I really enjoy THE SURVIVAL PODCAST. It's not really about surviving the rise of the zombies... more about preparing for everyday emergencies like storms and earthquakes, homesteading, and permaculture. This episode on basic preparedness is a good place to start. http://www.thesurvivalpodcast.com/holy-crap-1  there's always about 5-7 minutes of sponsorship stuff at the front of every episode so you can skip ahead a little if you just want to get right to it."
"175","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","The portable power pack has a 12 volt battery inside.the same as your vehicle. It will may not run a fridge but will keep lights and small appliances running. You have to keep the vehicle running to keep the battery from dying."
"175","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","Re: the Freez-R-brix; The proof is in the testing."
"175","Lars Theriot","I also own this back-up power supply.... APC BE550G Back-UPS 550VA 8-outlet Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).  I have my TV internet and DirecTV running through it. I get about 45 minutes of back-up battery power, which isn't going to do much for me in a longer timeline emergency but when we have those annoying brown outs in the summer it keeps my DirecTV from resetting over and over and, as we all know, it takes a while for the Satellite to come back on line after even a short interruption of power."
"175","Laura V.","If the power goes out on your fridge, you can use your washing machine to store ice and perishables fro a pretty long time.  The drum is insulated ;)"
"175","Brian F.","JUST FYI

"175","Robert J.","All bets are off when ""the man comes down."""
"175","Oscar Sanchez","Don't use the washing machine. Get a cooler big enough for you. Keep your ice there and the things that really need to stay cold for the longest time. Now you also have a portable refrigerator. I like to wash all my veggies when I get home. That way they are ready to cook or eat and I don't need to wash them if the water goes out... The BIG ONE!!!!!"
"175","Steve M.","Refrigerators and freezers made in the last decade or so are very well insulated and will hold cold for a surprisingly long time if they remain unopened. The key is to cut the amount of time the doors are opened to the absolute minimum the diminish the loss of chill into the surrounding warmer environment."

What we are worried about now is the couple of houses on the edge of the ridge above is, technically Pasadena, and what they have done to hopefully prevent a recurrence of the disaster that almost took out our neighborhood during the last El Niño. The back yard and patio of one of them came down and caused a landslide that filled the backyards of all the houses above me, causing much building damage in the process. The landslide pretty much stopped against the side of my garage. Everyone has mostly recovered from that last event, and subsequently prepared for the new storms, but there's not much we can do to prepare for the probable lack of preparation of those homes above us in Pasadena."

"177","Christy R.","Has anyone hired someone to fill and place sandbags for them?"
"177","Libby P.","Be aware that flood insurance covers damage caused by RISING water only (typically a body of water overrunning its banks).  I live on a hillside, as many in this area do.  A year ago I added earthquake insurance and asked about adding flood insurance.  That’s when I learned that damage caused by water coming DOWN (aka rain!) and saturating the earth is not a flood, but a landslide. And landslides are not covered by flood insurance nor by ordinary homeowner’s insurance.  Coverage for mud/landslides requires a separate policy generally called landslide insurance.  When I looked into it a year ago, I found that landslide insurance for my property would cost $1,400/year.  That is in addition to the cost of my ordinary homeowner’s insurance ($900/year) and the separate policy for EQ (an additional $1,200/year). It’s so expensive that I decided not to get the insurance in a drought year.  With the prediction of El Nino for this year, I went back to the same broker who quoted the $1,400.  According to her, no insurer offers landslide insurance in California anymore.  If anyone finds a way to cover mud/landslide, please post here!"
"177","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","Libby, It appears that coverage depends upon the cause of the landslide. See http://www.losangelesinsurancelawyerblog.com/2015/05/05/insurance-coverage-in-california-for-landslides-and-earth-movement-the-difficult-and-slippery-road/"
"177","DS S.","Each property is different. I can't speak to Libby's particular situation, in my mind an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of insurance. Retaining walls with gravity drainage cost much, do the numbers. Amortize improvements over insurance payments, your intended stay and increased resale value. I much prefer permits and construction costs over insurance and tax loss claims."
"177","Susan R.","Starting Jan 1, 2016 there are now new options available on earthquake insurance with new lower premiums.   So, if you have earthquake insurance now, now is the time to review it with your insurance agent.    And, if you don't have earthquake insurance now is the time to get some new quotes on the homechoice option with new and/or different coverages and deductibles.

Honda EU2000i Portable Generator, 2000 W is around $900.00 and that would run quite a few things around the house, a refrigerator, charging devices, radios etc, it's a small and very quiet portable generator, if you buy one, make sure you run it from time to time and change out the gasoline it in at least once a year, otherwise when you need it, it's not gonna run. Also have some way to secure and hide it from public view during emergencies, otherwise someone else will have your power supply when you least expect it. Also keep a good supply of high quality extension cords and splitters to get your power where it's needed. And, you need some way to get gasoline from your car to the generator, siphon etc. You can buy a lot more generator for a lot less $$$, but it will not be as good as the Honda."

Sure, prepare your home and family, just in case we actually do get rain -- many reports say that it is not certain that there will be rain sufficient to end the drought. The winter is the normal rain season here and it is objectionable that now people are being made to fear the natural cycle that brings rain to CA. Are the state or city govts building new reservoirs to store all of this predicted water/rain? -- haven't seen anything reported in terms of increasing reservoirs for storage of water at the state level. There is something fishy with this whole agenda."
"193","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","Oh well, prepare as you deem necessary. I'm not selling anything nor do I have an interest in anything being sold. My only agenda is to help inform. I've no control over the weather. I  just listen to the experts who are saying that this year's El Nino is the strongest on record. It's more than just the normal rainy season.  If you recall all of the property damage from the last one in 1997-98, it behooves us to prepare. https://goo.gl/PlsBTd

Hopefully, the rains will help to refill the existing reservoirs that have been depleted by the last several years of drought. How much you are personally affected really depends upon where your home is situated and how well prepared you are to handle whatever comes your way. Better safe than sorry."

"193","Rebecca J.","El Nino or not, everyone should have an emergency kit in California due to earthquakes. Seems like this preparation would not be wasted time or money.

will give you a chance to get your questions answered."

"" Water is insidious. It will find any available path into your house. Check your roof for damage.

Also, assess how water sits on your foundation and try creating slopes away. This is one time when runoff is your friend, away from your foundation so it doesn't weaken the concrete over years.

"204","Jamie R.","well, one thing i'm doing is i'm trying to get something growing in my backyard which is currently a dust bowl.  the last few rains brought lots of mud sliding down my nearly quarter of an acre dirt-backyard (which slopes uphill from my house).  so i put down some drought-tolerant ground-cover seeds and i'm giving it just enough water to (hopefully) get it to germinate and then hopefully the roots will make the ground permeable again.

if i can get the rock-hard dirt to soften up, i'll add some flexible edging perpendicular to the flow of water to slow it down coming down my backyard in a few places.  might do this with cheap 2x4s & some brackets, instead, or in addition to.

i'm also going to have to (not looking forward to this) scoop tons of mud up from around the house, and i probably need to build up a small concrete area by the garage door because sheets of water typically run across the garage floor with moderate rainfall.

i will also put a ladder into a permanent position to climb up onto the garage roof, b/c i have to unclog the drain every single time it rains.  just so glad i don't have gutters on the whole house to contend with (the neighbor's eucalyptus trees drop litter constantly and clog things up in very short order, and i rather dislike being outside on ladders in the rain).

i wonder if any of my fellow hill-dwellers who have also been devoted to zero-landscaping-water-use on their bigger patches of land are facing similar tasks?!  :P  doesn't help that my dogs helped wear it down and i also always kept the grass short because it was the foxtail kind that my dogs liked to snort up when it got tall enough to seed.

p.s.: anyone else feel like they really grouped these neighborhoods together oddly?  there are adjacent hills neighborhoods with more in common with us that aren't included in the grouping, and then there's this huge section of atwater, which is on the other side of the river from us and is disproportionate in size compared to most neighborhoods.  i do realize i can turn neighborhoods on and off, but i can't add neighborhoods to the list that aren't in it.  why do we get atwater (on the other side of the freeway), but none of eagle rock which shares a main thoroughfare with us (eagle rock blvd), highland park which also does (york & division), or more of cypress park?  i want the neighborhoods in my list that i frequently walk to and spend time in.  atwater just doesn't happen to be one of them, and i see more posts from atwater than anywhere else.  :\"

"208","Kris G.","I certainly would like to ""weigh-in"" on this.  
I live at the top of Museum.  I remember several years ago driving home one early evening from work and seeing workers installing these grills on all of the under curb storm drains and thinking to myself:  ""does this include these installers to come back after rain storms and clear them up or will street services have a drain clearing vehicle come around and gather up all the flood residue?""  OF COURSE NOT!!!!!!! Recently I was told back in December that our City Councilman is responsible for what streets  get cleaned and what streets don't by Brian McCormick the Sanitation Wastewater Manager of the Dept. of Public Works.  I have seen ONE street cleaner up here in two years, much less every week!!  What's that all about??
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT ""REPORTING CLOGGED DRAINS??!!!  I for one, have requested clean-up a billion times to no avail.  Every grated storm drain on Museum is completely covered with mud and debris.
Whoever got the contract to install these drain grates laughed all the way to the bank and the entity that gave them the contract should be hung from the highest tree upon the highest peak of Mt. Washington!!!
Fortunately our property values up here continue to surge, however our streets are DEFINITELY not the reason.  After a rain, the streets look like Syria!
As usual, the City did this without any consideration or thought on how the aftermath was going to be handled.  They get a salary for brain-storming about rain-storming.  HUH??  How are they not responsible???  
Property Taxes and DWP charges fatten their purses and we get NOTHING in return.  The stupidity that goes into budgeting by excluding normal services is mind boggling in itself!
Not so many years ago, I was fined $1,000.00 for not brush clearing the City easement at the end of my property.  It's a ""no-win"" proposition.  It is clear to me that the City is already putting their load on us for the impending El Nino Event.
The issues that I have had with regard to storm drains has been monumental so far this year, and whether it's CERT, SANITATION SERVICES, CITY COUNCIL, BUILDING & SAFETY, CITY ENGINEERING, .....it's always the same ""mazed"" response:  ""That's not our department, it's........""
The truth of the matter is, it's not frustrating, it's IMPOSSIBLE!
You may be reading this, thinking it's merely ""moaning and groaning"".  NOT!! I have been victimized by two massive floods into my property in the last 9 months because of the clogged storm drain jutting out into the canyon above me that was released to clear their street above, San Rafael........and trust me that had been reported many times!!
BTW, my property was cleared, but it will never be restored to it's original condition!"
"208","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","Kris, 
CERT is not a city agency, it is  a volunteer organization sponsored by  LAFD. We believe in neighbors helping neighbors and in doing whatever we can to avert any dangerous situation if we can do so safely.  I only advised to inspect and possibly clear drains in your neighborhood because you are the ones who will suffer if floods come your way.  As you have noted, we cannot always depend upon city services to take care of everything even if it is a reasonable expectation."
"208","candice c.","We have a huge storm drain at the front of our corner lot at a bus stop. We/I clear the drain after or during every rain.  The whole family in our muji raincoats, with hand troughs and racks and shovels.  We have the best time and often clear other drains around the hood. It is our volunteer work , I guess .  You can see our daughters (when she was 11ish) YouTube video starring her dad as DRAiN MAN in DRAIN MAN.Drain cleaning is up there 
as our favorite family thing to do together. We feel like we own the neighborhood being the only ones out in the rain."
"208","Judy Reidel","We're out there cleaning drains whenever it rains. 3 nearby neighbors now all join in taking turns to go out in the rain and remove the leaves that keep coming.  When water was above my boots the barefooted method worked well instead."
"208","Jamie R.","Kris, a potentially good way to get to your city council person is to talk to your neighborhood council.  they can then raise the issue as a neighborhood-wide issue, and then it's seen as something more than a single person's complaint.  it would be a good idea if you could take photos of what you're describing in order to drive home the seriousness, to ensure the neighborhood council understands & conveys the appropriate level of urgency.

and just a thought, though admittedly i don't know how this works... do you think the reason they installed the grates was perhaps not to frustrate and cause flooding in your vicinity, but because sans-grates, the storm drains were filling up, clogging, and overflowing, causing costly repairs & /or flooding further downstream?  it's uncool that you're getting the flooding instead, of course, but as a tax payer, i do approve overall of measures to protect our shared infrastructure.  that said, there's no excuse for not properly maintaining it, or ignoring the secluded hilly pockets.  especially when property values (and, thus, property taxes) have more than doubled in the last decade.

i'm so sorry to hear about the flooding.  it's amazing how incredibly destructive even a tiny amount of water is, and how many people fail to realize how severely that slight amount of water damages literally everything in the home it contacts, and the home itself.  :(  if you have pictures of any of the massive amounts of work you had to do, piling wet furniture in the garage, refinishing floors, replacing plaster or drywall, copies of astronomical mold remediation bills, bring that stuff with you and leave copies with the neighborhood council to use as a case study of what happens to (and get a count if you can) X number of Mt Washington residents as a result of storm drain grate neglect.

good luck!"

"224","Dave W.","If Mayor Garcetti was actually serious about helping our children,  he would honor his pledge when he swore to ""uphold our laws"".   Garcetti's support of ""Sanctuary City"" non-enforcement of our laws is disgraceful and illegal.  Allowing non-citizens to freely over-crowd our schools  is NOT helping our students one bit.  Not only class-sizes are burdened, but books and lunches are costly.  Squandering our taxes is not wise, , and maybe that's why there's not enough money for other needed projects."
"224","Sue A.","to Joan - I too agree that it is a shame that some of the preschools have been canceled. However some of the skills you mentioned :  learn to write letters, numbers, their names, colors  - are not developmentally appropriate for that age child.  Preschoolers need to learn by playing and experimenting and experiencing. Then they have a foundation for learning, writing and numbers when they get to kindergarten. In fact as a former kindergarten teacher I feel the academic push in LAUSD kindergartens is not developmentally appropriate - some of the children will do well - some will get along sort of - and others will learn to hate school because of failure."
"224","Sue A.","Preschools are important also for the opportunity to discover if a child needs specialist help in learning to speak clearly, has hearing problems, needs correction for poor eye sight or other visual problems. The earlier the child receives intervention, the more beneficial is the help - and the child can then enter school without also having to deal with these aspects which would make learning more difficult"

"224","Mavis W.","Everything mentioned in the article is nothing new. How about breaking down LAUSD, and handing control over to the local districts so with their schools can determine what works best for their primary clients...the students. Programs are fantastic, but what about the restoration of the physical education and arts classes that serve a different part of the mind? What about removing all of the redundant, time consuming testing and getting back to ""real"" teaching? My daughters are products of the Magnet Program decades ago and were educated by fantastic!, engaging teachers. Each instructor [they had] from elementary through high school put their hearts into their ""art of teaching"". But, prior to any of the changes being implemented by the City of LA, the priority of education must begin with the parents. Parents must be engaged throughout the education process, first by making it a priority in the home, being engaged with the teachers (particularly), and at the appropriate levels fostering a relationship with their child's counselors. Parents are the key to successful education whether they're home all day or work all day. Those programs offered by the government are external factors and may be a help, but home is the foundation."

"224","Jackie C.","As a retired teacher with 36 years public and private and can agree that this is nothing new. Let the teachers do what they were trained to do. Give them the time and freedom to get to know each of their students and what they need. LAUSD will never be broken down into smaller independent districts. We have heard that for as long as I can remember."
"224","John A.","The mayor and all politicians are on the wrong track when it comes to education.  Why do you think we have a major shortage in teachers?  It is less a questions of money than a question of respect.
With time politicians corrupted the unions especially UTLA to destroy the family fell and the collegiality in schools.  They split the faculty and make them work against each other rather than together.  Administrations has no respect for teachers, they humiliate them when they can and they try to push them out of the door.
What ruined education is social promotion and the one size fits all in high school.  Students get to high school with a level of 5th graders or less and the administrations blame it on teachers.  Where is the standard of discipline for students?  Students have more rights than teachers, they cuss them and sometimes physically abuse them and the teachers have no support.
Who wants to be a teacher when they hear all the horror stories?  Parents are not aware of the facts, they also blame the teachers for their child's failure when many failed to educate their child in the first place.  Good parents, you have your child next to problem ones and nobody cares.  The only worry of districts is the number of students behind a desk and the money they will get from the state.
Education is not only doing well on a standardized test, but also values and civil behavior.

Retired teacher from LAUSD high school.

"224","Robert O.","I am a retired aerospace engineer that for the for the last few years (and continuing) has volunteered as a technology mentor at a LAUSD inner city high school. In these last few years I have noticed a steady decline in science, technical, and vocational education. While the school may have access to some federally funded programs such as Project Lead The Way, the school administrators seem to sabotage or at very least discourage these programs through numerous methods, such as excessively late equipment funding approvals, termination of technical & science events/programs, not accepting help from influential parties, etc.

Perhaps this is because the administrators are more concerned or focused on educating the students to perform better on the exist exams, pressuring their teachers to ""teach to the test,"" instead of doing their job. God forbid educators actually be allowed to educate students.  This does not help most of the students, since many do not go to college. However, if the students had some training or knowledge in practical technical or vocational education, they stand a much better chance of being employed in higher-paying local or even technical industry jobs. Some of the local businesses are even willing to advise and help setup such vocational education, because they need employees with these skills.

It seems that while the Mayor's programs are well intentioned, intended benefits seem as if they will neither reach the students in the manner in which the program promises nor will they lead to any significant improvement in the status quo as the potency of the program will be vastly diluted by the administrators. Perhaps the educational system (at least LAUSD) needs a paradigm shift on how and what type of education can really benefit the students and aid them in becoming productive, contributing members of society. That's just my two cents."
"224","Terry F.","Is it possible for LAUSD to be any more screwed up than it is?  What has happened with the multimillion dollar iPad project that flopped because LAUSD used an inferior software program?  As a property owner, I am done voting for bond issues for LAUSD because the funds are continually squandered on unsuccessful programs."

"224","Robert O.","Yes, indeed I agree with Ken Robinson with the lack of teaching creativity. When I mentor students, I try to give the students confidence to try to come up with their own solutions and not fear failure, but look at is as an opportunity to learn to find their own solution. Also learn to make-do with available resources and improvise, in-spite lack of support (material and otherwise) and 'complications' from administrators."
"224","Jackie J.","LAUSD is too corrupt and bureaucratic to operate effectively.  Also it is too large.  As a parent who was active at Westchester when my child was a student there a few years ago I can only say it's a nightmare.  

There are some great people within the system but  it consumes them,  swallows them up and spits them out. Schools don't have enough finds to operate after dealing with the screwy accounting system LAUSD uses."

"224","Patty G.","I just got home from taking my daughter off to college and trying to catch up.  So I didn't get to read all the replies yet, but have to answer Rian J.  Back when I was in school (a while back I admit) in Woodland Hills, we started the school year after Labor Day.  Now the LAUSD is starting the school year in mid August, when the temperatures in the San Fernando Valley can easily get over 100 degrees for several days.  So I won't begrudge the students for finding it too hot to concentrate in the classrooms under those conditions nowadays, especially when the district has a poor record when it comes to checking the A/C units before school starts.  Maybe where you, Rian J, live is a bit cooler.  Here in the Valley, it's not.  One solution would be to revert back to the previous start date in September, even though it's still very hot here, and the A/C is needed for health and safety reasons here."

Thankfully, LA has many university model schools that allow us to pick and choose classes. Also, so many cultural, science and tech opportunities I call it schlep schooling as we are rarely home. And yes....my son is very socialized. But, again, living here in this city affords us nothing but high level learning and creative opportunities. It's not hard to homeschool here it just takes a little research and talking to a neighbor or two. I also agree Ken Robinson says it better than anyone. He is a homeschool hero!"
"224","Patty G.","Norma, I'm referring to sitting in a hot classroom in August.  It's so unnecessary to start school in August.  I grew up in Woodland Hills and we didn't have AC in our schools, but summer school was held in the mornings.  The actual school year started the day after Labor Day. Still hot, but at least a few less weeks of hot.  I have lived within a few miles of the Pacific Ocean and didn't have AC in my apartment.  But comparing schools in Venice and on the west side to Valley schools when it comes to weather is ridiculous.  

The City of Los Angeles is so widespread that when you're reading about a situation on Next Door, you have to remember that your own neighborhood may not have that same problem.

"240","Ryan Allen","Hi Adrian and Allen, nice to meet you both.  It's pretty easy to go through the process of getting the trees at your place.  The type of tree is determined by a couple factors like what's on the street already and what will fit in the given space.  I'd be glad to meet up over there and go over what the options are, and how we will go about getting the tree at your place.

And dealing with Vincent Burditt, the Field Representative for the 10th Council District? (Herb Wesson Jr., President of the City Council is our Councilman; he is also the person who split the Koreatown area so that 3 different City Council districts cover the area.)

"240","Ryan Allen","And the local Neighborhood Councils are a great resource that can help provide funding for a project if we needed to ask for some, but don't do the physical projects themselves.  That's where KYCC can come in and make the project happen.

"240","Ter Hash","@ Kendrick, although frequent accidents at your intersection is unfortunate and your concerns are genuine, imagine how a four way stop sign would affect traffic flow along Pico, especially since there is a signal 500 feet away at Arlington. 
I rarely use 2nd Ave/Westchester to make left turns or to cross Pico. It's much easier to go to 4th Ave or the signaled intersection on Arlington/15th St, depending on where I need to go. 
I've lived in this neighborhood my whole life and there are always accidents at Arlington/Country Club, Arlington/Olympic, Crenshaw/Olympic...more than I've seen at Pico/2nd Ave./Arlington.  Speed bumps installed on Country Club haven't reduced accident rates at Arlington/Country Club."
"240","Kendrick Rustad","I wasn't asking for a four way stop, but speed bumps on Westchester Place and 2nd avenue might help.  Maybe a NO LEFT TURN sign on both sides of the street?  I'm just afraid of a car getting rammed into my store or the new café across the street.  Which has almost happened.  Thank God there wasn't a pedestrian on the corner.  The accidents have been pretty bad.  Cars speed through the light at Arlington and Pico and then cars try to dart across Pico from 2nd or Westchester Place.  I think a little inconvenience is worth a life."
"240","Kendrick Rustad","I just found out, after talking with Dante, the owner of Café Dabang on the opposite corner, that a few weeks ago there was an accident where a wheel came flying off a car and almost hit one of his customers sitting at one of the tables on the sidewalk."
"240","Ter Hash","I misunderstood what you were requesting. Speed bumps on Westchester/2nd might help as long as they're not too far from the corner, which is the problem on Country Club. Speed bumps are too far from the signal so cars can speed up and try to beat the light."
"240","Natalie Epstein","When considering tree species can we be mindful of the current water situation and choose drought tolerant?  Also,  there is a really bad bump in the road on James M Wood between Hobart and Serrano and seems like a root system below ground.

"240","Adrian Collins","Hi Natalie,

Those bumps on James M. Wood are the result of an eye-witnessed water main break about 7 years back; never fully correctly resurfaced, FYI...  Best,  Adrian"
"240","Ryan Allen","@Natalie.  We definitely try to plant the lowest water use trees we can.  There are a lot of different considerations that go into picking the right tree species like how much space is available in the ground, overhead wires, other trees on the street etc.  This helps narrow it down so the right tree goes in the right place!  Let's see how many trees we might be able to plant in the neighborhood, and then we can plan a date to get our neighbors out to plant with us!"
"240","Allen Tombello","Yo Adrian- It seems like our dreams of new trees have gone up in smoke... maybe it is time to form a neighborhood council.."
"240","Ryan Allen","@Allen, keep the dream.  I've been super busy with work and haven't had time to get out and look at the locations yet, but we can most definitely get trees planted.  Summer isn't the best time to plant because it's so hot. But we can get things together for a planting in late Sept./Oct."
"240","Adrian Collins","Hi Allen, 

I have faith and confidence that our objective will be met and exceeded, it's a multi-person process which moves at its own pace.  

After all, we've been without the trees for at least seven years now and are only now making great, strides toward their replacement.

Ryan, I appreciate your commitment and know we'll see the trees planted as time permits.  I too am extremely busy with my endeavors

Hopefully we can rent an electric hole digger...

Best,

"240","Ryan Allen","@Adrian.  Let your landlord know that it costs about $.08 a month to water a newly planted tree.  They also conserve water by filtering water into the soil.  And even the Mayor has said don't water your lawn, but DO water your trees."
"240","Ryan Allen","And the LADWP rebate program pays $3.75 per square foot of turf removed that's replaced with drought tolerant plants and landscaping.  You can basically get a brand new yard or parkway for free, and might even come out ahead in the end!"
"241","Michelle Cote","HI Tomika - you're my neighbor!  I'm the short haired woman who once thought you were being harassed by someone on the street but was wrong.  Sorry about that!"
"241","Tomika Bruen","Hi Michelle! Yes, I remember you. No problem at all. I was confused - was focused on letting my dog out because I was running late. Hahaha. Have a great day and see you around, I'm sure. :)"
"242","Robert S.","What are the boundries of Batt 5?  I thought this area was Battalion 14? I am a callout member so just checking."
"242","Sandi F.","What is CERT?"
"242","Topanga B.","Since the new LAFD realignment, we are all LAFD West and the batt station has changed from Cahuenga and DeLongpre to Bronson and Hollywood. 
CERT stands for Community Emergency Response Team - which a group of trained volunteers assisting the Los Angeles (and Los Angeles County) Fire Department.) CERT is called out in emergency situations such as the ruptured gas main at Cahuenga and Yucca in late May. During that incident, CERT provided cooling stations for firefighters and incidental ancilliary services to LAFD as requested. It's a great group to belong to and a great way to know and serve your neighbors and neighborhood."
"242","Jim F.","I am a CERT member. I took the course and got my certificate over a few weeks. It is well worth the time. I encourage everyone to take the course. There are many new things that I learned there but mostly be prepared with food and water (for your family and your pets)."
"242","Evelyn A.","Will there be a CERT course in the Valley?"
"242","Soraya D.","I took the course a long time ago. I wonder if there is new information? Has anyone taken it recently? I found the triage segment useful and appreciated actually using a fire extinguisher on a fire!"
"242","DonnaAnn W.","I want to take it, but it's soooo long."
"242","Elliott P.","Im taking mine right now. Last class next tuesday. Im enjoying it and its worth doing. Luckily I got the 3 week six hours a week course. Its worth doing Donna."
"242","Wen-Chia P.","I took mine last winter in westchester fd it was a good course and learned alot. There is a emergency preparedness meeting on ashwood in the fall."

"242","Albert G.","Hi Sharlene,no anyone can take the training,go to cert-la.com and click on fine a class to see the schedule."
"242","Christine P.","The CERT classes are held all over the city.  I'm taking the class in Hollywood right now.  As Albert G. mentioned, you can go to the CERT-LA.COM page or click here and scroll down to get idea of where the classes are being held now:  http://www.eventbrite.com/o/lafd-cert-program-7803155391"
"242","Gerald C.","The same thing happened to me six years ago. All of the plants in front of my house died. I had to pull out two trees and lost three hedges.  I would come home from work and find runnels of liquid draining from my garden. Someone poured something poisonous on my soil on a semi-regular basis for about a month."
"242","Elizabeth W.","God, that is awful."
"242","Cindy D.","CERT is an EXCELLENT training program!!  We have a couple of people in our neighborhood trained and prepared for emergencies that might come up!  Highly Recommend!!"
"242","Becky D.","I have been a CERT 3 for about 8 years and highly recommend this training. It is offered through LAFD."

"244","Will G.","It's a great course!"
"244","Elliott P.","I signed also, pretty excited."
"244","Leslie M.","I took the course several years back. Wonderful info. Even if you go to the website, it's full of info and tips. The more people that are informed, the better. Less panic and troubles on top of disaster."
"244","Elliott P.","Is there anything I need to bring to the class Leslie?"
"244","Janet B.","It is a great class.  You will be so better prepared for yourselves and families in the event of a disaster.  It's interesting too."
"244","Leslie M.","Just bring your attention :)"

"244","Elliott P.","I did my first class today and enjoyed it alot. Cant wait for the next one."
"244","vincent ababao","Concerning sold out classes, you could RSVP in other Eventbrite like the two classes at downtown LA. Also to CERT grads, you could attend REFRESHERS or Drills to enhance and develop your skills. I attended the AREA E Disaster Drill at Norwalk this 6/6/2015 and Valley CERT Refresher at Fire Stn 88 this weekend 6/27. Don't stop there , keep on rolling.There's an EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FAIR at Westwood on July 12, 2015 , Sunday at 10822 Wilshire Blvd. See u there. Tks."
"244","Elliott P.","Hey vincent.  I shall more than likely want to know more steps on how to learn more. So any advise would be appreciated after I have finshed with these cert classes."
"244","Kathleen F.","When my husband and I were block captains we took the CERT training classes with a couple of other neighbors and found the training extremely useful and informative. I highly recommend anyone able and willing to take the course."
"244","Christine P.","After you take the Level 1 CERT course, you can go on to take Levels 2 & 3 as well, if you wish.  More information is available at the website:  http://www.cert-la.com/"
"244","Alfredo B.","Hey neighbors,

Happy late-4th of July.  It feels great to have sites like nextdoor.com available to our neighbors.  
We all live busy lives and sometimes it's hard to communicate with our neighbors next door let alone neighbors across the street or two blocks away,  nextdoor.com has made it possible for us to realize how much we have in common when it comes to city safety, infrastructure, governance, crime, education, and most importantly the desire of action through self empowerment.

I would like to introduce you guys to a new mobile application which aims at empowering the user to take control of their emergencies from the palm of their hand. for more information feel free to visit www.911ResQ.com 

Phase 1 functionalities which are currently operational allow the user to find the nearest service provider based on their urgency and their GPS location

Future phases of the mobile application will enhance the medical, police,  and fire department interfaces with the user.  Such improvements and innovations to come have one goal in mind and that is to appropriately transfer the right data which will result in reduced service provider response times and  subsequently an increased number of saved lives.

if you have any questions regarding the mobile application please do not hesitate to ask or better yet if you have any suggestions send me a message for potential consideration to be included in the next iteration of the mobile app..  

Very Respectfully,

Alfredo Bocanegra

"244","Julie B.","When will it start again? Thanks :)"
"244","Leslie M.","Www.CERT-LA.com posts schedules and a wealth of info on preparedness, videos, etc. great knowledge."
"244","Will G.","In addition to CERT courses (which are excellent!), there are also Red Cross courses (typically excellent, as well!), and Ham Radio classes (very useful when/if the Mobile network goes down).  There are excellent local self-defense classes, more extensive martial art classes, and even a few target ranges throughout the Valley.  

When things ""go wrong"" (and it truly is ""when"", not ""if""), it's nice to know what one can do to be able to deal with an emergency or crisis!

Good luck and stay safe out there!"
"245","Richard Gellis","Double hung wood frame windows are named that as they are hung by sash cords or chains and counter weights so as to enable the easy and stable opening and closing of them.  Sash cords do break and make the window hang off center and make the opening and closing of them not fluid.  Sash cords are not difficult to replace."

I got a call from a neighbor that lives near Gramercy Dr. & San Marino Street who went to check. Apparently the explosion came from the  overhead electric cable wires on San Marino between Gramercy Place & Wilton Pl. She reports smoking form the hanging cables. You may want to contact DWP to check to see when electricity will be turned on."

"254","Nancy K.","I receive phone calls EVERY DAY from supposed contractors looking for work.  I am sure these are scam calls and feel my name must be on some kind of list.  I will report the phone numbers to the DO NOT CALL website."
"254","Ivan F.","Not all unlicensed contractors defraud consumers. I am a licensed swimming pool service contractor and being in the industry for over 14 years, I've seen several licensed contractors defraud consumers. Licensed or not, anyone can commit fraud. It's just easier to catch licensed over unlicensed."

"254","Monique B.","I would add two caveats to these warnings by City Attorney Feuer: (1) when checking the Contractor's Licensing Board, look to see if the contractor has any complaints or is not carrying workers' comp insurance. Many licensed contractors have employees or crews and for that they must carry worker's comp insurance. Otherwise, if a worker is injured on your property, you as the homeowner can be sued. If the contractor doesn't have the insurance, move on to someone else; (2) licensees can be crooks too. After being lied to about the workmanship he performed on a trenchless sewer line for over 2 years after installation, I was forced to file complaints with the Contractors' Board, the plumber's bond holder and sue him in Small Claims Court, where he boldly continued to lie. His workmanship was faulty and he tried to cover up his error (severing the junction to a second sewer line) by lying. He has other complaints filed against him and has crews but no workers' comp insurance. And this was a referral from a trusted source."
"254","Joan D.","Last evening I received a call from a Contractor company saying I needed to landscape my front yard and they told me what my front yard looked like to a T. How do you think they could do that and have my home number. Told them I was not interested and they began to go non about the DWP fines if we didn't do it."
"254","Biana L.","If you're looking for a licensed, professional contractor that you can trust, my husband has worked on several houses in the neighborhood and will be happy to come give you an estimate.he has over a decade of experience and can turn your visions into reality. If you're interested, let me know and I'll be happy to send you his contact information."
"254","Cara L.","As mentioned above, licensed or unlicensed contractors, or anyone for that matter can commit fraud.  There are plenty of very honest and hardworking handymen helping people to do quality work at an affordable price.  The unlicensed part should not be the focus of this thread.  The fact that there are scam artists out there is the real problem.  Using people that come highly recommended is your best defense against being scammed."
"254","Andrea P.","Please investigate the Home Center.  I get calls from them almost daily.  It is obvious that it is a boiler room operation because when I ask for their license number, an address and a good number to call them back, they say they will only provide a number to a call center, and not a business.  I do not want any work done and am supposed to be on a do not call list.  I consider their calls harassment and the fact that they say they will ONLY give me the license number and business information if they can come to my home and give me an estimate is one big giant red flag.  How can we stop these calls?  Is there a sting operation I can be a part of?  Seriously, they call early in the morning and late at night as well as other times of the day.  I do not screen my calls because I have an elderly mother and would not want to miss a call about regarding her health.  Any ideas?"

"264","John Maliga","I went to a CERT course at Ramparts Village and was bored to the point of dropping-out. It was the cult of personality, where a senior FD staffer told stories, belittled participants, and brandished her knowledge. Modern pedagogy might, instead, include an online course where self-directed individuals can learn and test the facts they know. For one or two sessions, the remaining hands-on work could focus on usable skills, while avoiding the boredom of multiple required classes. The instructor said that this was a respected course nationally, so I must assume that almost everyone nationally is poorly prepared for CERT. We can do better, and I would like to be part of it when we do."
"264","LAFD CERT Central Bureau Coordinator Carolyn O. Burleson","John, Sorry that you feel that way. Of course we can always do better, but you are the first person I've ever hear say the training was boring.  I actually attended that training and did not get that impression at all. We do recognize that there are various learning styles and not everyone learns the same way. There actually is an online class that you can take, http://www.citizencorps.fema.gov/cert/IS317/basics/basics/index01.htm  but in order to be on an active team, you also must take the face-to-face training."

Lucy Jones is a great speaker and her year's work on the Resilience Plan is impressive.  The Mayor and his team actually got competing wireless carriers to sign a MOA for users to be able to cross carriers during a disaster.  Meaning, I'm at AT&T customer - and if their cell towers go down - I can hop onto Sprint's network during a disaster.  Color me impressed."

#2 anything that goes into a city owned recycle bin becomes the property of the city. 
#3 saying it's ok for someone to break a law no matter how small is not the right example we want to say to our young people.
#4 most of the people diving into our recyclable bins are either illegal aliens, retired people, or people needing money to get more drugs. 
#5 some people have made this into a business and become territorial in the areas that they cover. They get violent when another person steps on their turf. 

Do you want these kind of people in your neighborhood. I know people who earn good money $80,000 or more who does this on the side to earn an extra income. 
It's not ok to break the law. Change the city code that is stated on your blue trash bin if you think it's ok for people to take from the city. Defeats the purpose of a recycle bin."

i consult on the insurance for military and commercial rocket launches, big ticket pensions and property insurance and other crazy types of coverages.

"276","Nirav D.","My understanding is that the deductibles for earthquake insurance are 10-15%. So the first $40k on a $400k structure would be your out of pocket cost. How are you getting a $0 deductible policy?"
"276","Sharon S.","Earthquake insurance is so important....you cant predict how your how your home and valuables will be affected.  A pipe break resulting in flood, Crack in pool, or foundation..even items in the garage falling on to your car....all are very costly and can create avoidable debt. Don't rely on FEMA.  Get insurance,  take pictures of your items as record in case you need proof after an earthquake to file a claim.  

Another necessity is to make sure your that if you did need to rebuild your home that your policy is  for present day costs.  Construction materials and  complying to present building codes are different from even a few years ago,and much more expensive."
"276","reg n.","good question!

altho it depends on how a policy is underwritten, earthquake is often an odd kind of coverage. 

my policy in the 90s featured a $10k deductible. 

however, since i incurred a TOTAL LOSS, the carrier paid the entire ($168k structure) face amount of the policy; i.e., the deductible ""came back in"" -or- my cost was $0 (out of pocket). 

but thats ancient history and in the 21st century as you seem to know, california quake coverage is issued by CEA on a relatively standard basis:

http://www.earthquakeauthority.com/insurancepolicies/home/Pages/default.aspx"
"276","reg n.","nope nothing we can do... i had e/q insurance in 1994. then i had total loss and a partial loss, repaired them both, bought another e/q damaged property and repaired that one, too. insurance, las vegas, life, death, boom, bust... its all a crap shoot. some guess better than others... some just lucky! some unlucky... many of us have viewpoints/recommendations. hilltop living and witnessing your neighbors slopes crumble add an additional prospective."
"276","Kimberlee L.","Insurance agent here- earthquake coverage is very odd. Feel free to PM me if you have questions about it. For compliance reasons, I'm not allowed to go into details in public forums. But I'm happy to give you the good, bad and ugly about what is and isn't covered."
"276","Tom T.","Note that cross phone emergency carriers ONLY works if you have a phone compatible with the other carrier's system.  For example, if you have a GSM phone on AT&T, it likely will not work on Sprint which is CDMA, and vice-versa...   Some phones are multi-carrier but by no means all of them."
"276","Leslie R.","Current proposal is to finance this on the backs of renters living in pre-1980 buildings to the tune of an additional $75-150 per month. Meanwhile the housing commission is looking for state aid to pay any landlords' cost. The mayor has a dream, and lower-income people are going to pay for it."
"276","Tom T.","Yep, I had EQ insurance through State Farm and they paid the entire amount with no deductible in the 94 EQ...  Those days are gone forever however and they no longer even write EQ insurance...  CEA insurance is very expensive and limited in coverage with a high deductible.  It is of dubious value.  Geovera is a private EQ insurance provider with a somewhat better policy but they are also quite expensive..."
"276","Raj D.","Quake Insurance is falsely presented and rigged by the State for agents selling policies currently available on the market.  Unless you have a grandfathered policy, u have a massive deductible/total loss policy that is full of loopholes...  California is a state that is careless of its long established citizens/rapidly fleeing taxpayers.  There are no services for anybody when you need them regardless of how rich or poor you may be.  When we have a massive quake, 90% of us will go under and not generate any further tax revenue for an incompetently run state.  Soon everybody will be forced to move.  This is what happens when we let random uneducated people vote for office..."
"276","Tom T.","We plan to leave the state when we retire in a few years so hopefully the quake will hold off until then...  :)"
"276","Clarisse Marrero H.","The insurance companies area in charge and it is a no win situation unless you pay through the nose.  However,nothing in life is permanent so focusing on just surviving the quake should be first.  It is what we do as neighbors afterward that counts."
"276","Susan R.","Not exactly true.   All insurance companies go through the http://www.earthquakeauthority.com  
The closer you are to the fault line, the more you pay.  There is more risk involved.  The farther away from the fault line the less you pay.   And, premiums also depend on what coverage you pick.   You can pick to only cover the home or you can add additional coverages like going to a hotel called loss of use.   You can also add personal property or go with the minimum amount available and that is $5,000 or with the maximum available on personal property of $100,000.

Ask your homeowners insurance company or agent for a quote.  Or you can quote it yourself at http://www.earthquakeauthority.com"
"276","Cate R.","This is off topic, but Mayor Garcetti, I want to commend you for standing up
for the homeless  a few weeks back when the city council was ready to throw them to the wolves. Now recently I read that 98% of funds spent on the homeless goes to law enforcement who get sent to chase them off time and again!!f I were the chief of police I would be tempted to tell the city council to do it themselves.  Some police already have an image problem.  But when it comes to the homeless situation, it's not the police who created or ignored the problem.  Maybe if the council members had to get out there themselves and do the dirty work they'd get inspired to actually do something about it.  
Stay in the light, Mayor Garcetti"
"276","Susan R.","This is how LAPD gets funded.    10,000 police officers but only 5,000 on the street at any one time."
"276","Jamie R.","not sure if you guys know this, but the CEA (california earthquake authority) is actually not a for-profit business.  i am as inclined to expect an insurance company to be ripping me off as anyone, but then i was happily surprised to find out that CEA is not for profit.  and they're currently doing a brace-and-bolt program that pays $3000 toward homeowners doing seismic retrofits, which is from the excess money they earned recently.  they pay it back to the customers.  we recently took advantage of the brace-and-bolt program.  was very cool to only pay $1600 of the $4600 job!  :D  oh, and we'll also get a small (10% i think?) discount on our earthquake insurance now that the house is bolted.

not sure what people consider expensive, but we only pay $70/mo for earthquake, which is less than we pay in car insurance for liability for our vehicles, and a LOT less than we'd pay if we had full coverage on both of them.  sure, it adds to the cost of insuring the house substantially, but relative to the other expenses, it's really not so bad.  property taxes are by far the lion's share of the amount we pay into the escrow account each month when we make our mortgage payment.

i guess the one question is, what will be covered?  obviously you can't rebuild a historic home, so our house will be forever lost, but can a new house be built of comparable size, shape and quality (so that we can sell it for enough to buy a historic home that was NOT damaged) if a quake destroys ours?  i can't remember the last time we looked at this info.  we probably need to look again and make sure the coverage is good enough... but at least i don't feel like they're ripping us off by charging us whatever they feel like to put a bunch of money in the pockets of the fat cats and shareholders.  we as CEA participants, ARE the shareholders.  so that's good, at least.  :\  i just hope an earthquake doesn't destroy our house!  i hope our seismic retrofitting was enough to save it!!!"

It's a bloody joke. If they simply put these on the ballot every other November, what at the very least every seat in the house is up for grabs, they'd easily have 10x as many folks going to vote. Not to mention every time we DIDN'T have an election in March, we'd probably save enough $$ to feed everyone on skid row for a month."

THIS IS NOT A RUMOR.
  I can tell you for a fact that Huizar people  at the Eagle Rock City Hall office came out and removed 4
Gloria Molina signs that I posted.
    One was on private property so I reposted.
I stated that it was on private property and the owner gave me permission. 
    There reply  was I know the owner and she was going to have a talk with him.
   She proceeded into the business to talk to him.
One should not be intimidated  by his staff.
    Yet the the DWP building on Yosemite Drive in Eagle rock, they had Huizar signs.
just look at Huntington  Drive in El Sereno how many Huizar signs he posted on the median which is public property.
   You don't call that an abuse  of office or double 
standards. What do you call it?
   311 says it's not against the law.
I said it was. Transferred  to city ethics office
just received the run around on phone system 
that didn't let you leave a message.
    Thank god the contracted Gardners
were cutting the grass and removing  his garbage.

NELA Neighbors in CD1 (especially Glassell Park and Mt. Washington) - Urgent action needed! And please share!
 A developer is bulldozing the hillside at Barryknoll. Please write Gerald Gubatan (gerald.gubatan@lacity.org), Jose Rodriguez (jose.a.rodriguez@lacity.org) and cc Greg.Shoop@lacity.org, gp.mollytaylor@gmail.com and hschpk@earthlink.net and please put these points in your emails:
 * * * * *
 Re: 3933 and 3941 Barryknoll
 I am greatly disturbed by the actions of the developer at 3933 & 3941 Barryknoll and request that the Council Office put an immediate Stop Work Order for the following reasons:
 - The lots in question were re-zoned to a lower density zone (from R1 to RE-11) in the 1990's pursuant to a process that began in the 1970's. The purpose of the re-zoning was to mitigate the inadequate infrastructure in the hillside areas of the City - the City choose to do this in order to lower the density on some lots instead of fixing the infrastructure problems. The City has ignored these impacts and this issue on the Barryknoll projects and has instead approved projects at the original higher density. As a result the project violates CEQA and the City's General Plan.
 - This project was deliberately piece-mealed by the developer and their representatives to deceive this community and to avoid doing s full EIR which is warranted for a development of this size.
 - The environmentals and the extent of this development was never fully vetted with the community.
 - Because of the scale of this project which is really a development of 17-18 homes, we want all proposed projects on Barryknoll to be looked at collectively for their cumulative impact on the community.
 - By allowing this to move forward, the City is ignoring its own downsizing that took place in the 1990s making these RE-11 lots due to the inadequate infrastructure on this hillside.
 For these reasons, I am asking for you and the Council Office to support the community. This is a public safety issue since nothing is being done to improve infrastructure. This project needs a full EIR to study the cumulative impacts.
 Any questions, PM me."

I did everything I could to learn about them, but frankly, I felt like I'd be throwing darts with a blindfold on.  (By the way, I feel like this in larger elections when it comes to voting on Judicial candidates). The campaign literature and the incessant phone calls are more of a nuisance than educational, and are often just smere campaigns.

I don't know what your beef is, whether you just have it in for certain public officials or you just like screaming for attention, but get a grip. If you don't like giving everyone a voice then maybe you should get off of NextDoor and start your own app where only you and your special friends are allowed."
"282","Yvonne E.","Hello, All. The City of Los Angeles sought another method of communicating to its residents. It chose NextDoor.

"282","Tom T.","Look at the choices in L.A...    For the most part you can vote for a liberal democrat, a liberal democrat or perhaps a liberal democrat...  Even though most L.A. races are theoretically nonpartisan, most of the candidates running are all cut from the same cloth, and the few that aren't have no real hope of overcoming the incumbent, political, money, and/or union machines, as the case may be...  There are occasional exceptions, of course, but not many.  And this discourages many voters from participating because, yes, they ARE fed up and see no real point.  And this is not only true just in L.A., it is true across more and more of the country... 

And now, with the passage of Prop 1 and 2 (election date change), we will be stuck with King Wesson for an additional 18 months!  ;)"

"282","Sandee A.","Dear Chatsworth Residents:

Our Neighborhood Council election is on Saturday, March 21. That is one week from tomorrow. Voting will take place 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., March 21, at the Chatsworth Train Depot, 10038 Old Depot Plaza Road. 
Please put a reminder in your cell phone to make a quick stop to the train depot that day and fill in some bubbles.

I attended the Chatsworth Neighborhood Council (CNC) candidate forum. I walked away with some interesting perspective. Half of the people running have never even been to a neighborhood council meeting. Not only that, but none of them could answer or even knew about the auxiliary committees in which they will be asked to also be a part of (at least two). Most have recently moved to Chatsworth. In addition, these people are all from the same religious institution which is currently seeking approval from Land Use to build on the corner of Topanga just north of Chatsworth Street next to Ride On. This is a huge conflict of interest and we cannot allow persons with blatant and deliberate conflicts of interest on our governing boards. When queried about the apparent COI’s, they had looks as if that thought had never even occurred to them before. None of these candidates had a statement regarding what they would do for Chatsworth. If they do not have even enough interest in our community to attend normally scheduled neighborhood council meetings or any of the seven auxiliary committee meetings, what are they going to offer us going forward?

I urge you to not make this mistake with your vote. It is important that you get down to vote next Saturday if you do not want what will surely be radical change. Their numbers are great, and our numbers need to be greater. Do not let people that do not care about our community make decisions on your behalf.

We need Board members that will continue our great lives in Chatsworth. Peace, beautification and safety in our residential communities, maintaining great schools so our kids get great educations, preservation of open spaces and horse keeping, many are volunteer law enforcement and have close ties to LAPD Devonshire Division and the local Sherriff’s office, several are local business owners and help make Chatsworth an attractive place to work, and have dedicated their lives to serving the Chatsworth community by currently being on the CNC and auxiliary committees for many years. We have low crime, low graffiti, and members that really hold Chatsworth in their hearts.

For those reasons, I am happy to endorse the following candidates, as they stand for maintaining what Chatsworth is really all about:

Dan Huffman
Dorothy Allison
Kamesh Aysola
Larry Heller
Les Himes
Mary Kaufman
Michael Harris
Michael Pries
Rudy Schultz
Vicki Briskman

If any of you have any questions or would like to look at my in depth notes I took during this CNC meeting, please PM me. I will be happy to share the notes I have.
Thank you, and please vote. It’s very important. Candidate information is in the link below.

I prefer if you book through the website as that will allow you to rebook, write reviews, plus I can get you $10 off with your first booking.

"296","Elizabeth Isralowitz","If you don't mind me asking how did you get a section 8 voucher?   I have a family I am working with who desperately needs this for themselves and their children with developmental disabilities."
"296","Rory White","HI Elizabeth, and thanks for the very good question.  Families and families with disabilities are prioritized.  

Below i wrote a very comprehensive answer to your query.

maybe TOO comprehensive.   save it as a resource if you don't
use it.    but it just might be a very good overview of getting Section 8.

There are many ways to proceed to begin the often long, but very very well worth it, road to getting a Section 8 Voucher.  Are you helping as a friend, or are you a worker in the helping professions, social work, etc.?  

Many programs prioritize if the family is homeless ...which can have an expanded definition, but definitely has criteria, as in some programs will accept ""couch surfing"" ...going from friend's house to friend's house... as homeless, others will not.  

being in a Domestic Violence shelter is considered homeless, and then families impacted by DV (acronym of domestic violence) often have ""paths to section 8"" available through DV Shelters which are usually 90 day programs or longer...   However, just being a family in need is enough.  

The problem is that the Section 8 Vouchers are often ""closed"", and yet getting on track through one of the aforementioned or similar programs will both begin the process and some of those programs will still ""have vouchers"" that have been committed to them, while the City may officially, since all vouchers have been given out or committed, be technically ""out of vouchers"" and even taking no names on their waiting lists.   

Which, in reverse order, brings us back to the most simple normal way to apply, which is to contact the local Section 8 administering Body, and apply.  However, sometimes they will not be taking applications nor taking names to put on their Waiting List, even, as they are simply exhausted at that time period with their ability to get more vouchers.

The local govt body is HACLA   (Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles)  (there is also a Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles  HAOCLA i think it's acronym is).

HACLA is on Wilshire Blvd near Coronado st... (west of MacArthur Park).

Bottomline, if HACLA is taking no applicants or names on waiting lists (ALWAYS put one's name on a waiting list even if it sounds hopeless or ridiculous, as even if it takes a couple years, then when the person's name comes UP, they might very well need the Sect 8 Voucher, or whatever program they are applying for....  I simply put my name on a 3-5 year waiting list up in Washington State once, even before moving there and then blink of an  eye and those years came to pass and i was ""up at bat"".

However, since there possibly (more than likely, but not sure) technically no section 8 vouchers or waiting lists at HACLA... go there anywhere, get an appointment for your family... but also find a Family Advocacy Agency, Family Service Agency, to apply with who then can advocate for the family.    finding a good one is important... not sure who is good right now... but search online... you could try Jewish Family Services... just grabbing a name out of the blue, and have no idea if they are relevant.   (they do not prioritize Jewish applicants, they simply are Jewish Family Services... e.g. i went to Asian Pacific Counseling Center for services and i am not Asian).    

Parallel to getting an agency to advocate is to find a Housing Program to get in, a low income Housing Complex....     there, the Section 8 supports the apartment, not the person, meaning you can not take the voucher with you after residency there... but the family pays super-low rent, down to almost nothing depending on their income, or no income... usually 1/3 of Income is rent, at least for single persons like me...   

When the govt is NOT giving out Vouchers, this does not mean that many many Low Income buildings do not still have ""vouchers"" that are subsidizing the apartment itself.....

Thus, though these can also be hard to find... (but never let ""hard"" or ""difficult"" or ""remote"" EVER dissuade you... you ALREADY know that.... but you pursue these things until they come/open up etc.)  nevertheless you apply to buildings...

The famous ""Projects"" often associated with ghettoizatioin (society attempting to squish all poor people into one place) are examples of Low Income Housing Projects... but they are NOT just in the classic famous ""Projects"" (which might be just fine, depending on which niche the family finds in one, but obviously the famous gangy or druggy dynamics often associated with some of the Projects are to be avoided if at all possible).

To make it clear there are tons of Low Income Family Housing Buildings (you can technically call them all ""projects"", ""project"" is neither a bad word nor only associated with the ""famous"" projects...)    If the family can apply and get accepted into such, then it is as good as Section 8, except they can't take the voucher with them.  BUT keep your eye out for such Low Income Family Housing Buildings/Programs that ALSO include within them a dynamic or ""track"" to get their own voucher.  Many have these.  THAT is how i got my voucher in L.A. i got into a building, and ultimately the building program offered me the voucher.

look for links off HACLA or HAoCLA's sites for subsidized housing links... they will have many that say Section 8 Voucher accepted and others that will NOT accept Sect 8 Vounchers, but offer the same discount as sect 8 voucher to the applicants... again sometimes leading to getting a voucher down the line.

one list is called, i think www.SocialServe.com    click on California and then many cities will be listed mostly southern calif and mostly l.a. county.... then click on the districts or areas.... and see what they have.

it can be intimidating and difficult.  alice in wonderland, but persevere.

also there is another site, GoSection8.com, that lists section 8 accepting places (but you already must have your section 8, and yet SOME times there are listings on there for buildings not requiring section 8).  i think the SocialServe.com is possibly better it's from HAoCLA  (housing authority of county of los angeles)  You would keep your eye peeled for places that don't take section 8, but have subsidized sliding scales and the like.  Some give JUST as good a deal as section 8, but some give more moderate discounts that can help some, but not be enough help for others... depends on what income your family has if any. (if they do NOT have an income, they should obviously apply for help.... the ""GAIN"" program of the govt gives money to families with dependent children  (program used to be called Aid to Families with Dependent Children or AFDC, but i think is now called GAIN, it is probably accessed through the DPSS or Department of Public Social Services, that has an office in mid-wilshire area).

this may all seem overwhelming or intimidating but i think i just
spat out a very good overview of how to get section 8.

i would save it somewhere as a resource.   

if it's too bewildering, again, simply start by finding 
a Family Service Agency.    Jewish Family Services pops in my mind but i have zero idea of working with them.

out on the west side, santa monica area 
OPCC (Ocean Park Commiunity Center was the original name)
has a Family Services Department.

they also have a few very limited but amazing Family Buildings they 
are coordinated with.

one such building, but you must have an advocate or agency apply,
is, i think  A Family Place or maybe also called UpWard Bound... 

it looks very upscale and used to be beautiful and probably still is.

good hunting, may God be gracious to you,
and if you need more specific advice you 
can email me at roreeewhite@hotmail.com
but put in the subject heading something so i know
it's not spam.

blessings,

"302","Claire J.","The off ramp from 405 going north is intolerable. Turning left needs to be made from two lanes, not one. Traffic signals must be changed as cars are left unable to turn when light is green. Light at Church lane must be changed to allow this. There needs to be 2 turns lanes off freeway to go left. Cars are trapped on freeway all the way back to wilshire blvd. The off ramp nees two lanes not one at entrance off freeway. We need movement on Sunset.

We need fire protection for SM Mountains in Brentwood. you mention only Bel Air.
Yes, Parking must be changed along North Bundy as roads are not wide enough.

Archer School must not be expanded in anyway.
We moved into this Brentwood area to have peace and quiet and enjoy moving around town. We can't now!"
"302","Dan F.","Thank you for reminding us of the extreme heat that's coming with the Santa Ana winds and the associated fire danger.

But there's another problem:
* Sylmar's Station 91 has but 1 fire truck and 1 ambulance. 
* Station 91 is the largest geographic area within the Battalion area.
* Station 91 is the 3rd busiest fire station in the San Fernando Valley with 15-18 calls per day on average. 
* Most calls are medical which means our 1 fire truck is out running medical calls (that's the rule LAFD operates under). 
* Sylmar is situated next to the San Gabriel Mountains - we all know about the many devastating fires we’ve had, the hundreds of homes burned down, and the numerous evacuations we've had.

Station 91 needs more equipment and human resources.

Sylmar needs a 2nd fire station!"

A single unit, no matter how good or valiant can barely cope with the area and needs during normal times.  A fire emergency leaves us bare and open to the destructive power we have been witness to too many times.  It is time for the City to take more seriously its obligation to protect the lives and property of its residents and citizens.  I second the call for another Sylmar Fire Station which both the size of the area involved and the level of risk on a daily basis, certainly deserves.  Further, I would recommend that any new Fire Station be located above the 210 Freeway so that should earthquake collapse any of the connecting overpasses we will have one company available on each side of the 210.  Our situation grows more threatening by the day.  It's time to begin the process."

And, their loud speakers booming into homes 8 times a day every day shows the most disrespect of all.  But when Father Marco Ortiz took me to court in retaliation for an ABC7 interview that showed how low this so-called ""church"" could go.   He lost.

"311","Sharon W.","Hi Susan

I' am all for church events and them having activities in the community.  I also believe in people including Churches, respecting the communities where these events take place.

 There should have been community outreach to the stakeholder's informing them of the event, what the event was for, and the hours it would take place. also asking the community to participate and share they're views about the activities, and the possible noise threshold.

It all boils down to respect.  I Hope the church does a better job in outreach to the stakeholders, the next time they are planning their activities."
